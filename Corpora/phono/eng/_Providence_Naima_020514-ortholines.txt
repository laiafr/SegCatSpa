do you wanna try again or do you want me to try it for you
today is Thursday August
twenty eighth
you're making a big tower there
a tower with candles on top
wow
who's the tower for
mumbudy
who's mumbudy
and a what
a lick full of homes
wow
look at that
that's a big big tower
look at that
what does sclaiming mean
it's sclaiming
I guess you do but I don't
is that a word you made up
what does it mean
it clicks up
that's what sclaiming means
you mean when the legos click together
hm
d'you want me to hold that
kay
hm
see that's making it not fit
I guess it does actually fit
it might fall over though
oh a present for him
are you going to give it to him
what a beautiful
what a beautiful
what is it
oh what a beautiful tower
you need to do what
cocanit
is that another word you made up
oh
what does it mean
his back home cave
what does
mm
mhm
oop
are you upset that that fell
you want something to put the tree on
whoop
I think
woo
that's because that's in the way
here
okay
yeah
mm
you know I think we need to stabilize it
like that
you can put things on there
there
and I bet this would also stabilize it if we put this right here
then it won't fall so easily
you wanna put it on top of this
okay
mm
he's gonna be so happy
it's so nice when someone gives you a present
sometimes people give presents on birthdays or holidays but sometimes people give each other presents just 'cause they want to
mm look Sleepy Naima made you a present
you're gonna what it
is that another new word
what does that mean
babilize
oh you mean stabilize it
look Sleepy Naima made you a tower
this blackberry bush
oh
oh yep that's a good idea
yeah you could put that one up there
whoa woopsie daisy
you know what
we can put it back together
how about if we made one that was a little more stable and it wouldn't fall down as easily
wait a minute
let's make it taller
we can still make it tall
mm oh
oh that's a nice
you could put it right on top of that one actually
yeah
it
it'll go there
they can't really go next to each other
I think you have to put it on top
for it to fit
what a nice tree
it looks just like a tree
is it a tree tower
you could make another tree
it's gonna what
butter mill
hm
what what does butter milling mean
what does bweeleelee mean
bweeleelee
bweeleelee
bweeleelee
Sleepy Bear wants to know what that means
bweeleelee
he used to say those things when he
oh those were the baby words he used
oh you're using those words
mm
is he saying thank you
mm
he is
when you're first making it
and then will you say you're welcome Sleepy Bear
want me to stabilize it
is that what Sleepy Bear's saying
it looks like he's looking at it and he likes it
do we have any more like those
pajama pajama pajama
this tower has a snail on it
hey what are you doing there
bring that back
you were trying to take it off
why
excuse me
Naima you took off
you took the cord out of the
socket
why did you do that
okay
you don't know why you did
you want some breakfast
do you wanna eat pancakes
blueberry pancakes
with blueberries inside them
I think we have little maple syrup
oh really
I didn't realize that
it looked to me yesterday like we had a fair bit
no but
you mean not enough for pancakes for breakfast
yeah for
oh well Naima could have just pancakes with the blueberries in them and eat them like muffins
the ones that are from yesterday
that are in the fridge
do you want to have some yogurt
would you like some kiwi
the Stitchta Bear is loofing
what does that mean
he's what
pajumming
you hit the ball and the panda bear throws it to Sleepy Bear
and what's that called
budging up
he's budging up
he's watching what
he pinches his mommy
he's pinching you I see that now
you could say
if you're his mommy you could say don't pinch me Sleepy Bear that doesn't feel good
you have to teach him Naima
'cause if he's a toddler bear he needs to learn what the rules are and how to be with people like you don't pinch people and you don't hit people
you don't hurt people
what're you gonna tell him
right you still can say it in a nice way but he still needs to learn
oh no
you don't wanna hurt your bear
sounds like the border
across the border crossing from
Saint Stephen is gotten very slowed down
did you read this article
no
it's
they're not saying that but they're implying it 'cause they're talking about new projects for upgrading border crossings
frustrating to passengers
I bet since
'cause we
when did we cross there
was it after nine eleven
it wasn't it was before
yeah
I have a feeling it's really
slowed down
the bear's in the chair
are you in the chair
are you sitting with your bear in the chair
let's have the kiwi
did you say you wanted some
well let's go find it
mm
well I'm gonna carry my tea and I'm gonna carry
the backpack and I'm gonna find your kiwi and then I'm gonna slice it so my hands are gonna actually be fairly busy
do you wanna sit here at this table Naima
I think maybe I'll clear off this table and we can all sit and have breakfast at this table which is a little more comfortable
you're stabilizing those towers
it does
okay
I'm thinking I would like to someday I don't know if it's the next year or the year after
splurge and get a really nice kind of baronial kind of a place
and and like everybody
well actually
I mean family all family
oh
have some kind of a
oh a very you mean
like for the whole time even
well for the whole
whatever
yeah
but but certainly like pick a weekend and say y'know we're gonna have a dinner party or a cookout
oh okay
or something
well to come this far up most people will wanna spend more than a weekend
sure
but and we'll need like less of advance notice to
well for instance here's a sleeps ten
mhm
six bathrooms
mhm
four king beds
where's that
Alice Head
ocean front
oh Alice Head
oh
I I recognize myself in that
is that
I do too
yeah
maybe Daddy can help you
may I help you Boo
okay can Daddy sit with you while you do it
yeah you need something to stabilize it
steak
you mean steak like what the bear eats in that book that kind of steak
hm
yeah well this is one of 'em
that I had in mind
what
I said this house is like exactly like what I had in mind
well there are a number that are huge like that I mean
for rent I don't know
yeah no I've seen sleeps
you can get sleeps eight sleeps ten
pretty easily but it doesn't mean they're
it's actually it's actually sumptuous accommodations
you're looking through Great Houses For A Family Vacation that's you your children and your friends each have their own
I thought Daddy said he was gonna sit with you
well I was refused
oh that's right
can I sit with you Boo and help
what do you want me to do
can I help
if I hold it
okay
can I make a suggestion
you don't wanna hear my idea
alright then I won't tell you my idea
you know you know why
you don't need to hear what you think
what what I think about it
because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego
see how this is wider
if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable
see this is wider and this is skinny and narrow
if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable
yeah even that is better
that if I were you I'd put that on the bottom
'cause that's really stable that's like a platform
it's a pretty big tower though
and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand that also helps
to keep it more stable
shall we have a civilized breakfast together
that would be nice
what do you think Naima Boo
do you wanna have breakfast together
I thought you wanted kiwi
kiwi is delicious
let's put the
she needs to pung it back Daddy
yes
oh you want me back here
okay
how 'bout if we stabilize it by putting it on that
it'll help
you don't think so
I'm stabilizing it
alright alright
you hold it
you know to make something more stable it will help if you
see
put the wider ones on the bottom and the narrow ones on the top
there there
see it's more stable look at how stable that is now
and the other thing is it's hard to make things stable on carpet like this
'cause it's sort of uneven
things would be more stable on that floor which is much more flat
see this is an uneven floor
well I meant this kind of
this part of the floor in the kitchen is more stable
we'll put this up here
what's who gonna try and do
I'm gonna peel the kiwi now
mm
oh
it's very unstable
oh that's pretty good but when it's that tall on such a narrow base it's often loses it's balance Booboo
hey that's pretty good
hey
you wanna show Mommy
hey Mommy
oh I see that's a really tall tower
look at that
yay
I think that when you put it on the kitchen floor and moved it from the carpet it helped a lot
she's making these as presents for Sleepy Bear
oh boy
he's a lucky bear
here's some kiwi
mhm
do you want to
I I'm happy to make a run and get some maple syrup 'cause it they have some
I wasn't going to suggest
I know but
well I don't
I mean there's toast and there's jam I don't
can you can you bring this over and give it to her and and try to wave it in front of her face or something
will you have some kiwi Boo
Daddy's gonna eat some have some
it's yummy
mm
oh you're right there's hardly any syrup
do we have a syrup mouse in the house
we do
I've been using it in my cereal when I have cereal
oh oh that's what
I use it ostensibly to cut the taste of the flax oil
allegedly
well I think it's enough for us to split that last pancake that was from yesterday
oh oh we could
and then we can have toast also
I mean since we're
we only have one
two more mornings here I wouldn't really be in favor of buying a whole maple syrup just for that 'cause I don't want to have to carry back a lot of
okay
half used food things
mhm
mm I think Naima likes kiwi Mommy
oh the chair is there
her special puffin place mat is up there
hey do you wanna sit up here and eat
sit properly
you have your puffin place mat that you like
did you hear a fog horn
oh yeah okay
do you remember that noise we heard last time
I mean at Head it was a grunting noise
Daddy said it was a fog horn but Mommy said she didn't think so
okay
whee this Baby oh
oh I didn't realize we're
the tape is running
yeah
okay this is just barely warm but
Naima do you want some pancake too
does
she doesn't have a mic does she
yeah
it's right here
oh
well doesn't it taste a little bit like muffin
it's like a blueberry muffin that's what I thought
is it also like a muffin shape
hm
mm
that looks pretty yummy
you wanna split this with me
sure
if there's enough
I think there's enough syrup for this
ridiculous
hm
these are luxury rentals throughout the world
oh
and there's one
there's one called Cirrhosis on the Sea
oh how awful
it is pathetic
hm oh here's an island
the wild beauty of Ireland freeze your ass off
what
it says that
no it doesn't
why are you even looking at this silly site
well 'cause I'm trying to find Maine coast stuff that might have
are you trying to find the most expensive
yeah it's it's like it's like googling right
trying to find like a really expensive thing
here have your pancake
thank you
let's all sit together
okay good
do you want some soy milk or skim milk
soy milk would be excellent
hey Miss Naima Boo
can have breakfast
with you with you Boo
and I'll put some toast in too
I don't want toast I might have something else
cereal
Daddy doesn't want some
why
well I don't think I need cereal but I'm thinking I might like to have some cereal
'cause I like my cereal
that's a good question
it's just a habit I got
I like eating cereal in the morning
just one end
how 'bout the other end
mm
what are we gonna do today Miss Naima
are we gonna go hiking
mhm
you wanna go looking for eagles
so do I
I wanna go to
Cobb's Cook Park and look for eagles
mhm
yes I saw the fly
and we might see seagulls in the water
mhm that would be fun
I don't think there are any bears
except Naima Bear
Naima Betsy Bear
Bitsy you're right
I forgot
is it good
it's all gone I'm sorry
that was just one kiwi and you ate it
and there's no more
you could have a baby yogurt
you could have
blue
blueberries
okay
mm
is that your blueberry song
mhm
which blueberries are the
there's
well there's some in the box the organic ones
yeah in this bowl
well that's the ones washed left over that aren't organic but you could give those to her I guess
they're not sprayed so
I'm gonna go fiddle with the laundry
there's your yogurt
I did knock it over I'm sorry
you can fix it after breakfast
there's some stems in here Baby oh so we can get rid of the stems if you like
and that green one you don't want to eat though
that's not ripe
but you can eat the rest
mhm well all you really need to do is take the stems off
you pinch the stems off like that
and then you can eat the berries
and that way you have more berries to eat
you don't want to throw away the berries
oh you don't want to throw away good berries when you could eat them
that would be a waste of good blueberries
especially these blueberries which are delicious
we should
I wonder if a little boy or a little girl picked these blueberries
hm I think it was a little boy who put them out
I saw a little boy putting them out
uhoh
we bought them on the road Naima
when we went to Machaias
oh you wanna look yourself
okay
Daddy will eat some more
hm this has not been
refrigerated
what's that
this blueberry jam has not been refrigerated
it should be okay
I guess but I'm gonna put it in the fridge now
what was I thinking
oh we should
we should try to visit the organic blueberry farm down the road
is it on
it is on the way to Cobb's Cook isn't it
no
or is it
no
it's on the way to Machaias
oh that's right
because otherwise we should call Gramps'
and give them a little heads up
if we're gonna do that
maybe we should
I think we should call Gramps'
it's a working day Tuesday
yeah
so
the only issues are whether Grandma's going on a cross country trip again
I wonder if he's
well and I wonder if they're at the Blue Hill Fair
oh
marketing or anything
I suppose so
we can give 'em a call
which starts tonight actually as far as I can tell
well
so
well if the weather's as good maybe we should take the trip
the problem
Sunday
to
Blue Hill Fair from
oh y'know it would make a lot more sense to get the blueberries except we'll have to buy
keep buying ice
from
and pick it up there
no I really would prefer Tuesday
but
'cause Gramps' Farm is out of the way
but we're not
I know
compared to Blue Hill
I mean
well they're both
I mean
Gramps' Farm is less out of the way than the Blue Hill Fair is
yeah but I think that trip to the Blue Hill Fair would be
right
good for other reasons
right but I'm just saying in terms of the tradeoff of several days of icing
and icebox versus taking the side trip to Gramps' Farm on the way home I'd prefer to take the side trip to Gramps' Farm
oh it's not the
yeah well it does
it's still a problem in terms of the timing of the trip
why
'cause we're gonna be under a lot of pressure to get
I know but
yeah
from Skudick
is that a reasonable stop
that's a very reasonable stop in fact it's almost an ideal stop it's about an hour and a half
okay well
actually maybe not
maybe an hour but still
is that a good breakfast Naima
yeah
how is that jam
I haven't had any
it's good
very blueberry y
not overly sweet
we could read that after breakfast
well I'm not gonna read it 'cause I'm eating my breakfast
and I'm gonna eat some cereal now so I
I'm not gonna read it
we'll read it to you as soon
really soon as soon as we finish breakfast
you wanna talk about what's in that book
yeah
Sal and her mother take some pails and go to Blueberry Hill don't they
why do they want to
why does the mother
her mother want to pick blueberries
that's right
her mother wants to can blueberries for next winter
that means
I know it probably sounds like it means put them in cans but it means put them in jars
like to make jam
yeah
on the stove and put it in jars and then store it keep it so that they will have blueberries all year round
we do that too except we put the blueberries in the freezer
so we have them all year round
almost all year round
so Naima gets to eat frozen blueberries
all year round
this is the time of year when people who have blueberry fields pick their blueberries
in fact that's probably a reason why they aren't at the Blue Hill Fair because 'cause it's probably peak time for picking
yeah
or maybe
oh little Sal finds mother crow and her children
little bear finds a mother partridge I think you're right
there are a lot of mothers and children in that book don't you think
mother
Sal's mother and Sal
the mother bear and little bear
and the mother partridge and the mother crow
and their children
I think that's all
who else
Little Bear are you eating your blueberries
gesundheit
gesundheit gesundheit
for two sneezes
oop
you need your spoon
I'll wash it
kiwi seeds
y'know I could take her cottage garden this morning if you wanna have a little reading morning for yourself and then we could do
yeah that's
we could do Cobb's Cook in the afternoon
I just wanna take a shower before I go out but
you wanna go on a hike this morning Naima
you wanna go on a hike with Mommy
and look at flowers and things like that
doesn't that sound like fun
hm
sour yogurt
are you gonna eat some
all that
mhm
oop
I think you dropped some blueberries out of the spoon
can you pick up the ones that're on the mat now and put them
Naima you know what you're doing now
you're making a mess
I'd like you to pick up the blueberries which are perfectly good to eat over here and either eat them or put them in your yogurt
and that goes for these over here too
these ones
pick them up and put them in the yogurt or eat them okay
good
there's some more though
over here
this is just some diapers that are on a rinse cycle I think when they're done when they start spinning I'm gonna jump in the shower
mhm
take a shower
thank you for cleaning up those blueberries now you can eat them
in fact
are you going a
for a hike with Mommy
to the to the cottage garden
yeah that's where we're gonna do our hiking
we can be bears
in the woods
I wonder if I should bring the backpack
huh
it's a little hard to do it if
just one person
you would like to hike on your own just walking wouldn't you
and if you wear sneakers then you'll have more traction and you won't slip
mm
like you did yesterday
when we were hiking and you had sandals on
remember
that was a nice hike we did
is something in your mouth
blueberry skin
mm I like that honey
oh is that the first time you're having the honey
no but I like
oh but it is nice it has a nice flavor
remember where we used to get crystallized honey all the time
I also like the texture 'cause it's semi crystallized
mhm
yep
it would be nice to
it would be nice to maybe bring back home some blueberry honey
you can't really get it on the Cape
mm
we could maybe get a bigger thing or some more
I think I got that in Eastport
in Eastport
yeah
but there must be
y'know
it must be all over
what did you say Naima about Blueberries For Sal
oh
kaplink kaplank kerplunk
what's that
mhm
then there was mother bear and little bear walking along
they were munching
munching berries and swallowing them
getting fat for the winter
'cause bears sleep the whole winter
did you know that
they sleep the whole winter
and so they need to eat a lot of food before they go to sleep just like you need to eat a lot of food at supper time so you'll have lots of food in your tummy when you go to sleep so you could sleep all night
mm
bears sleep all winter
they sleep for days and days and
they sleep all winter because
they get tired
that's a good question
well 'cause they're tired I guess
'cause they wouldn't have much to do all winter so
they don't like to waste any time
they sleep
that's a good question
I think because she heard him outside when he was going
and that
she was lying in bed
when she heard that sound outside her window
so she realized that she'd better do something or else she's not gonna sleep all night 'cause she'll be listening to the bear going
that bear had a bad toothache
I guess he didn't brush his teeth regularly
that's why
so she invited him in 'cause she wanted to help him so that he wouldn't have a toothache so he wouldn't be making so much noise all night so she could go to sleep
I think that's really why she helped him
and maybe she helped him because she didn't like hearing him suffer and be so miserable
maybe she wanted to make him feel better just so he would feel better
well you know like Daddy said you could pinch the stem off like that and then you could eat the berry
yes
did you
are you eating yogurt too or just blueberries
yogurt
I haven't seen you eat any yogurt
'cause
you have
okay
whatever you say
why don't you take another bite of yogurt
please
please
please
oh okay
Harbour
yeah Casko Bay doesn't
oh it's appealing to me
really
well it's a closed privacy
yes Boo
I think the tooth was aching 'cause maybe he had cavity and maybe he didn't brush his teeth regularly
maybe he ate too much honey
maybe the bear ate
hey Naima
Naima
I said
yeah you know you're not supposed to do that
you're making a mess
you're playing with blueberries and squishing them and making a mess
and that is gonna cause blueberry stains all over the table that Mommy and Daddy are gonna have to clean it up
y'know as you get a little bit older you're gonna have to start cleaning up you own mess
and then you'll be busy
you'll be very busy
unless you be
unless you're a little neater
you'll be very busy
Naima is be a busy girl
you're gonna be cleaning up your mess all day long
no
the bear drinks out of a big glass
does he drink out of a big glass
I didn't see that
oh you mean if he had cavities
well I think if he had cavities it was because he ate too much
maybe too much honey
too many
oh maybe he ate too much
too much salmon oh boy
they do okay
I didn't know that
oh d'you think his mommy was giving him bear food like your mommy gives you bear food
oh
and too much salmon so he got cavities
actually Naima I think it might have been from too much honey
not too much salmon
well because sweet things are a little worse for your teeth
but actually blueberries might be okay
I wouldn't be surprised if blueberries had things that are good for your teeth in them
polyphenols
polyphenols of various kinds
flavonoids
yeah
in fact I'm sure someone's gonna have to look into the
content of this new polyphenol
in blueberries somebody needs to check whether blueberries have a lot of of polyphenols
speaking of which there are blueberries on the floor
oh
blueberries on the floor Naima
why are there blueberries on the floor Baby oh
oh there's blueberries
Daddy's gonna get those blueberries
maloo
I see a lotta berries down here
Daddy's pickin' 'em up 'cause I don't wanna make a mess on the floor
blueberry stains are hard to clean
oh you're arm's meeting Daddy
very nice
Daddy's gonna eat some of these they look so good
mm mm mm mm
I think there's only like probably a couple minutes left on the battery
okay
so
can you turn it off and then
are you gonna sleep Baby oh
are you sleepy
you're in a bear cave
is it cozy
oh where are Grizzly and Sleepy
oh there's Sleepy where's Griz
Griz where are you
that was funny the other day
we couldn't find Griz and Sleepy and then Daddy just tripped over the chest and knocked it over and there they were
they may have been inside all along
Miss Naima you you
say that again
why did you want to go out with a bare bottom
you mean outside
I think 'cause maybe bugs would bite you on your bottom
did you want bugs to bite your bottom
you did
I didn't know that
why did you want bugs to bite your bottom
'cause it would feel good
oh
d'you think it feels good to have bugs bite you
I didn't think so
are you joking
I think you're joking
you're not joking
you're not joking
you're choking
you're not joking you're choking
oh my gosh
I didn't realize you're choking
what does that have to do with anything
Mom
you joking choking baby
what are you
a nukkaduk you're a nukkaduk
are you a nukkaduk
you're a ducky
okay are you done
okay
shall we clean
shall Daddy clean
oh you're gonna settle down in your nest
oh it looks nice and sunny over there in the nest
I think Daddy might wanna curl up in that nest with you
because the sun is coming down on that
oh
are you an earthworm
mm
oh you're a little snake
snakes slide around and slither
d'you know how to slither
oh boy
you should
you should show Daddy I'd like to see you slither
slithering snake
okay Boo
why don't we turn off the recorder and
'cause we're almost out of batteries anyway
ooh we are out of batteries
oh dear
