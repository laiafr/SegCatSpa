so we visit him at his house
church is God s house
we pray in church praying is like talking to God
I love you is a prayer God always likes to hear
we can also say thank you God or help me God or gee God I m sorry
we listen to God s words in church too
he speaks to us through stories from a book called the Bible
in the Bible God tells us about himself and how he wants us to live
when we think about God at church
no there s no more pages about how wonderful he is and how good he is to us
we think about all he has given up
what
right
what s this
right
what else do we do at church
we sing songs that we sing wait a minute we sing
songs that we sing at church are called hymns
God is happy when he hears us sing
when we leave church we say bye God I ll visit again soon
