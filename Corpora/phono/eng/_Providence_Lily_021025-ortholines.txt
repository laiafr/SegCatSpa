every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
do you remember what this rock is called
what's it called
it's called Pride rock
home to my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba
as part of the celebration I had a special duty
do you know what kind of animal he is
what does he look like to you
looks kind of like a mandrill to me
you think so
hm okay
I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
then I lifted the future king up high for all to see
the elephants trumpeted with their trunks the monkeys jumped up and down
what happened
oh my
can you patch it
and shake hands
yeah
oh
wow what colors did you put in that ball
whoa boy

yeah
yeah
okay I'll call you back bye
oh hello
oh yes would you like to sit next to me
oh alright
not far from the ceremony in a cave at the back side of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled
life's not fair I shall never be king
who's this
oh that's Scar
who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba
Zazu Mufasa's trusted advisor also appeared
you should have been first in line
I was first in line until the little hair ball was born said Scar and he stalked out of the cave
that's Zazu
yeah
before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
yes Honey
sure
sure
yes
should we try and make this so it's all one color or do you like it with lots of different colors
alright
so let's stretch it out a little bit let's put it down and we'll make a crocodile okay
you have to press really hard
all the way down very good
then we can take all the excess away like this
how's that is that good
then we can sort of pull it out like that
how's that
wow

that's nice cutting Honey
are you makin little pieces
yeah
would you like me to read the book to you Honey
you wanna finish Lion king or you wanna read Franklin
alright let's see where we were
later as Simba headed down the path he ran into Scar
hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride land
of Pride rock
my dad just showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all
Scar looked slyly at the young cub
he didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border did he
well no he said I can't go there
oh he's right said Scar it's far too dangerous
only the bravest lions go there
when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
come on I just heard about this great place he said
the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them
Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird
Nala led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him
once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala
then Nala flipped Simba onto his back
they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
Simba looked around and gasped
this is it we made it
before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down
we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands he said
and right now we're all in very real danger
suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull
frightened Simba Zazu and Nala jumped back
it was Banzai his partner Shenzi and the always laughing Ed
Banzai sneered a trio of trespassers
Zazu tried to lead the cuds cubs to safety but Zanzai grabbed Banzai grabbed him by the neck and plopped him down
the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
you know what Sweets can we keep that on the table
we don't want it to get stuck all over the rug right
nope
let's still read Lion king
okay
the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
what's the hurry we'd love you to stick around for dinner they said
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Simba Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away
but the hyenas weren't distracted for long
they gave chase and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could
finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones
just when it looked as if it was all over for the young cubs Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw
if you ever come near my son again he said
the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba
you deliberately disobeyed me I'm very disappointed in you
Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son
Simba peered up at his father
I was just trying to be brave like you he said
being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble he said
Dad we're pail we're pals right and we'll always be together right
Mufasa looked up at the stars
Simba let me tell you something my father told me
look at the stars
the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars so whenever you feel alone just remember those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
do you remember where did we see stars on the ceiling
did we go to the science museum in Boston
and we went to that planetarium
where all the stars were all over the sky
wasn't that neat
yeah
is there any Playdoh on the floor
thank you very much
Mommy has to go blow her nose one more time
I'll be right back
somewhere there is
okay
is there another oh another song coming up was that the last one
I think it may have been
I think perhaps so
oh yeah
okay Baby
that is a whole lot of Playdoh whoopie
oh okay one big ball huh
wow good luck
that's a big job
doo doo doo doo
wow
nice going Honey
oh alrighty
let's see
the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba
from a distance Mufasa noticed the rising dust
Scar appeared quickly at his side and said stampede in the gorge Simba's down there
without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son
Mufasa plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and put him on a nearby ledge
suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which star Scar stood looking down on him
help me Brother he said
Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper long live the king
and then let go of Mufasa
ooh gotta watch that Playdoh
Simba peered over the ridge
ooh Sweets can you pick that up please
no I think you can pick it up Sweetie because you dropped it on the floor
can you pick it up before it gets stepped on Sweetie
alright well I'll finish reading the book when you pick your Playdoh up
what are you making
really
oh
it looks like something very neat
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
you're a little stuffy
a little bit stuffy
yeah
what should we do with that Playdoh that's on the ground
because I see a piece right between us
and I'm still waiting for you to pick it up
that's good cutting Honey
squishy
what color do you think that Playdoh looks like
a little red
no
it does look like grey you're right
what else is grey
oh the sky is blue and grey
wow
what about cars does anyone you know have a grey car
you're right Nancy does have a grey car
wow

oh you're gonna put it all back together into one big ball
that's going to be great
