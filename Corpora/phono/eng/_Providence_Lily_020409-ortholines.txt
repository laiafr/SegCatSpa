red
but suddenly she heard a cough
and there sat Sam

whining lately
okay bring it over sweets
Nancy has these flowers that grow you see where her like drain her gutter is
mhm
it s just like a big massive vine but in the spring all these flowers come out
and they have to be in sunlight but in the shade you know what like the sun needs to beat down on the exterior but not the roots
yeah
it s this weird thing so it s hard to grown but
come sit with me
oh boy look what we have
Dora s backpack and the little mermaid which one should we read first
alright the little mermaid
wow
mommy has to yawn she s tired
under the sea was a bustling kingdom of mer people presided over by the just and noble king
Triton
king Tritan forbade the mer people to go above the water but whenever his youngest daughter Ariel could she and her best friend Flounder would sneak up the surface
Ariel was fascinated by the surface world and had a collection of human treasures
she and Flounder had even made friends with a seagull named Scuttle
one day Ariel saw a ship overhead and swam to the surface
on board was a handsome young man called
prince Eric
all of a sudden a storm broke and the sky turned dark thunder boomed and lightening crashed
howling wind tore at the ship s sails and giant waves tossed the vessel onto the jagged rocks
prince Eric was thrown into the ocean
Ariel frantically searched for the prince and when she spotted him she quickly swam over to him and pulled him to safety
once they were on shore Ariel sang quietly to the unconscious prince
at last he began to awaken minutes later the prince s servant sir Grimsby discovered him a girl rescued me said the prince groggily and she had the most beautiful voice
she has a very pretty voice was she singing
yeah
who else likes to sing
right
who s that
Ursula
is she nice or is she mean
she is mean
meanwhile in a dark corner of the sea lay the lair of Ursula the sea witch she had been bent on destroying king Tritan ever since he had thrown her out of his kingdom
she stared at the image of Ariel and Flounder in her crystal ball this pretty little daughter of his may be the key to Tritan s undoing she said
when Ariel returned home Tritan was very angry with her
never go there again he said and he
that is his triton he holds
and he destroyed all of Ariel s human treasures Ariel had that Ariel had collected from the surface
Ariel was very upset and she sought Ursula s help
in exchange for the mermaid s voice Ursula would transform Ariel s tail into legs
but she said the prince must fall in love with you by sunset on the third day that is he s got to kiss you
if not
well she s gonna
Ursula took her mermaid tail away and gave her legs instead right
and if prince Eric didn t kiss her on the third day Ariel would change back into a mermaid and become Ursula s slave forever
a short time later prince Eric and his dog Max found Ariel on the beach
you seem very familiar to me he said have we met
Ariel could only nod although she looked like the girl who had rescued him it Eric thought it couldn t be her because she couldn t speak much less sing
don t worry I ll help you said Eric and he brought Ariel back to his castle
but meanwhile Ursula hatched a plan to keep Eric from falling in love with Ariel she turned herself into a pretty girl named
Vanessa right
and she wore the shell containing Ariel s voice around her neck
that evening the prince heard someone singing it was the voice of the girl who had saved him
Eric went out to the balcony and saw Vanessa and fell under her wicked spell
when Ariel awoke the next morning she saw Eric with Vanessa
Ariel had lost her chance and was doomed to be Ursula s slave forever
that s Deborah going to work
aboard the wedding ship Scuttle saw Vanessa s reflection in the mirror and realized it was really Ursula
Scuttle and the other seagulls did their best to interrupt the wedding by flying at Vanessa
this is one the ship
a magic locket fell to the ground and shattered just as Ariel reached the ship
that looks like a little flower or something and this is some smoke maybe
oh that s right that s the necklace that broke you re absolutely right
do you wanna
it s okay
I ll call her back
you can talk said prince you re the one it was you all the time
happy at last the prince leaned over to kiss Ariel but seconds before the kiss the sun set
you re too late shouted Ursula Ariel looked down and saw that her legs had changed back into a tail
it s not you I m after said Ursula I ve got bigger fish to fry
and at those words king Tritan appeared
in return for his daughter s freedom the king agreed to take Ariel s place as Ursula s slave
at last this is mine Ursula cried placing
right that s her
that s Ariel s daddy s crown and his triton
Ursula grew monstrously huge but suddenly prince Eric appeared steering his ship through the raging waves right at Ursula
and the bough of the ship pierced her cold heart slowly the horrible sea witch sank beneath the waves forever
king Tritan s powers were restored and he realized how happy Eric and Ariel were
with his triton he changed Ariel s tail back into legs
yay
mm
how do you ask nicely
hm
what s what s this one about
Belle
and who s that
the beast
a young woman named Belle lived near the castle
Belle loved to read more than anything in the world
who else loves to read
you do like to read
her father Maurice was busy working on a new invention you ll win first prize at the fair tomorrow Belle predicted
but Maurice and his horse Philippe never made it to the fair they got lost and saw a castle
Maurice approached the castle and stepped inside
suddenly a huge beast stormed into the room a stranger he gravled growled and dragged Maurice into the dungeon
at that very moment Gaston a local hunter had arrived at Belle s house to propose marriage
say you ll marry me he said but Belle refused there was no way she d marry that conceited bully
Gaston left angrily
just then Philippe arrived with no rider where s papa
you must take me to him
I don t suppose she s French so maybe she just said where s papa huh
Belle rode through the forest braving the thick fog and frightening sounds when she found the castle
I m the master of this castle roared the beast
that s right
take me instead of my father said Belle
and the beast agreed there s the beast
there he is
you can go anywhere you like he said to Belle except the west wing and you will join me for dinner
back at the castle the beast waited for Belle to join him for dinner master said Lumiere this girl could be the one to break the spell
she ll always see me as a monster grumbled the beast
but one day at dinner the beast remembered his manners and later he and Belle shared a wonderful dance
the beast asked Belle if she was happy
oh yes said Belle if only I could see my father
so the beast brought Belle a magic mirror and her father appeared in it
but he was wondering lost in the forest you must go to him said the beast sadly but take the mirror so you can remember me
she left the castle and found her father and brought him home
but suddenly Gaston arrived with an angry crowd your father s crazy he think thinks he s seen a beast
but Belle had to convince everyone her father was not crazy so she picked up the magic mirror and showed the beast to the crowd
Gaston locked Belle and her father in the cellar and set off to find the beast
she s in her house
Belle and her father escaped from the cellar and also began riding towards the castle
when Belle and her father arrived the beast had Gaston by the throat
let me go cried Gaston and the beast felt sorry for him and released him
that s right they are wearing capes
oh right
hm
as the beast embraced Belle Gaston stabbed him in the back and the beast let out a terrible roar
Gaston tripped and fell off the balcony and was never to be seen again
the beast collapsed in Belle s arms you came back he said at least I got to see you one more time
Belle began to cry
oh no please said Belle I love you
and at Belle s words the beast became human again
it s me he said to Belle and all the household servants became human too
the spell was broken at last
