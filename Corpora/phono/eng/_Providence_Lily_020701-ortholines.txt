do you remember what Alec's baby's brother's name is
Max that's right
my two closest friends here both had babies two days apart
they were both in women and infants so I went
I went down the hall and saw one went down the hall and saw the other one
two baby boys
and I was so convinced that Max was going to be a girl like I was so convinced that I actually went out and bought a present for a baby girl and then like it's a boy and I'm like rats
back to Nordstrom's
I was so shocked I couldn't believe it
yes what should we read
yeah
I had never seen the movie I didn't realize it was kind of a downer
every morning as the sun peeks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
this is Pride rock
home my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock in honor
to to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba
one of the doctors that my grandmother had actually it's like no one could remember his name he's from India and we kept calling him doctor Mufasa
but like that's not his name I mean not to his face but like just us
yes I can yes I can
as part of the celebration I had a special duty I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
and I lifted the future king up high for all to see
not far from the ceremony in a cave at the backside of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled life's not fair I shall never be king
this was Mufasa's brother Scar who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba you should have been first in line
I was first in line until the little hair ball born and with that Scar stalked out of the cave
before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
look Simba everything the light touches is our kingdom
what about that shadowy place said Simba
that's beyond our borders you must never go there Simba
later as Simba headed back to the path he ran into Scar
hey uncle Scar guess what I'm going to be king of Pride rock my dad showed me the whole kingdom
he didn't show you what's beyond the rise at the northern borders said Scar
well no he said I can't go there
oh he's right only the bravest lions go there said Scar
when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
come on said Simba I just heard about this great place
Simba pounced on Nala and Nala flipped Simba on his back
they tumbled down the hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
we're way beyond the boundary of Pride rock
of the Pride lands said Nala
and we're in danger
suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull
a trio of trespassers said the hyenas
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw
I'm very disappointed in you Simba you deliberately disobeyed me he said
I was just trying to be brave like you
being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble said Mufasa
Dad we're pals right we'll always be together won't we
Simba said Mufasa let me tell you something my father told me
look at the stars the great kings of the past look down on us from the stars
so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
meanwhile Scar went to visit the hyenas
I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you and you couldn't even dispose of them
Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared for the death of the king
the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
your father has a marvelous surprise for you he said
Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeests directly towards Simba
wildebeests
didn't it
didn't we read that they were going to get a wildebeest in the zoo in our zoo
right
that's exciting
Mufasa took off to save his young son
but he plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and pulled him to a nearby ledge
suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
desperately he tried to climb
climb another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him
help me Brother he said
but Scar let go of Mufasa and he fell down
it was an accident said Scar I didn't mean for it to happen
what am I going to do said Simba
run away Simba said Scar run away and never return
Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne
meanwhile Simba plodded across the savanna without any food or water
and it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot sun
a big hearted wart hog named Pumbaa stumbled upon the young lion and he turned to his trusty pal a meerkat named Timon
he's so cute can't we keep him
are you nuts Pumbaa lions eat guys like us said Teemon Timon
you want some what
you want another sandwich
wow I'm impressed Honey
do you want another hummus sandwich
or do you want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
you want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
what kind of sandwich would you like Honey
you could also have a turkey sandwich or a ham sandwich
uhhuh
what do you want
hummus
another
yeah really boy
another hummus sandwich oh boy
maybe you wanna read the rest of the Lion king book to yourself Honey
well I can once I finish making your sandwich
Honey I'm making your sandwich
really
what would you like to eat

okay
yes I can let me just cut your sandwich first

yes I am
ooh that looks yummy
here's some water in your little baby cup yeah let me just get the phone
hello
hello

it occurred to me after I left a message that he wasn't there
Lily has her Brown thing now actually can I call you back in just a little bit
okay

I can
mm

I wanna eat it all up

I love you
I know that's the neatest backpack I've ever seen
mhm
Simba stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion
but eventually he got homesick
and one night he looked up at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him long ago
the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
the next day Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness
Simba came to his rescue but after wrestling with the lioness who easily flipped him on his back he realized she was his old friend Nala
why didn't you come back to Pride rock she asked you are the king
I'm not the king Scar is
Simba he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands there's no food or and no water
and if you don't do something soon everyone will starve
you're our only hope
Simba went to the reflecting pool and when he looked in the water he saw a lion
the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared
look inside yourself Simba you are more than what you have become
you must take your place in the circle of life
encouraged by his father's words Simba returned to Pride rock
when he arrived he found the land bare and dry
the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother
I'm the king said Scar if you were half the king Mufasa was I'm ten times the king Mufasa was
suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba
I'm a little surprised to see you alive Simba
give me one good reason I shouldn't rip you apart Scar
but Scar forced Simba to say in front of all the lions that he had caused his father's death
oh Simba you're in trouble again but this time daddy isn't here to save you and everyone knows why
Simba knowing the truth leapt on Scar
Nala and the other lionesses joined the battle
Scar tried to escape
and Simba ran after him Scar pleaded with his nephew
run away Scar said Simba and never return
limping badly Scar
limping badly Simba climbed to the top of pride rock and let out a magnificent roar as he looked out over his kingdom
before long Pride rock flourished again Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had they had their own newborn cub
and I held him up for all the kingdom to see

I want hair like Dora's

exactly

Horton hatches the egg
this is a long one do you wanna read a shorter one
this one
you gonna help me read
sighed Maisy a lazy bird hatching an egg I'm tired and I'm bored and I've kinks in my
from sitting just sitting here day after day it's work how I hate it I'd much rather
right
I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest if I could find someone to stay on my
if I could find someone I'd fly away free
then Horton the elephant passed by her
right
hello called the lazy bird smiling her best you've nothing to do and I do need a rest
would you like to sit on the egg in my nest
the elephant laughed why of all silly things I haven't feathers and I haven't wings
me on your egg why that doesn't make sense your egg is so small mam and I am so
immense
tut tut answered Maisy I know you're not small but I'm sure you can do it no trouble
just sit on it softly you're gentle and kind come be a good fellow I know you
I can't said the elephant please begged the bird
I won't be gone long sir I give you
I'll hurry right back why I'll never be missed
very well said the elephant since you
you want a vacation go fly off and take it I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to
I'll stay and be faithful I mean what I say toodleloo sang out Maisy and fluttered
hm the first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
the first thing to do is to prop up this
and make it much stronger that has to be done
before I get on it I must weigh
then carefully tenderly gently he crept
up the trunk to the next where the little egg
slept
then Horton the elephant smiled now that's that and he sat and he sat
he's sitting on it he's keeping it warm
and he sat all that day and he kept the egg warm and he sat all that night through a
it poured and it lightning it thundered and rumbled this isn't much fun the poor elephant
I wish she'd come back because I'm cold and I'm wet I hope that that Maisy bird doesn't
but Maisy by this time was far beyond reach enjoying the sunshine way off in
and having such fun such a wonderful rest decided she'd never
great
let me grab the phone ringing
sure Sweetie
yes let me get it for you
let me get you some cold water
there's your ball
okay sweets
so Horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn the leaves
and then came the winter the snow and sleet and icicles hung from
his trunk and his feet but Horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it
I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through and then came the spring time with troubles
his friends gathered round and they shouted with glee look Horton the elephant's up in a
they taunted and teased him they yelled how absurd old Horton the elephant thinks he's a
they laughed and they laughed and they all ran away and Horton was lonely he wanted to
he sat on the egg and he
there's your water
I meant what I said and I said what I meant and elephant's faithful
no matter what happens this egg must be tended
but poor Horton's troubles were far far from
so for while Horton sat there so faithful so kind three hunters came sneaking up softly
behind
he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start three rifles were aiming right straight at his
oh no
did he run he did not
Horton stayed on that nest he held his head high and threw out his
he looked at the hunters as much as to say shoot if you must but I won't
I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
but the men didn't shoot much to Horton's surprise they dropped their three guns and they stared with
look they all shouted can such a thing be an elephant sitting on top of a
it's strange it's amazing it's wonderful new don't shoot him we'll catch him that's just
and it's just what we'll do
we'll take him alive why he's terribly funny we'll sell him back home to a circus for
oh my gosh
and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on they dug up his tree and put him inside with Horton so sad he practically
oh no
up out of the jungle up into the sky up over the mountains ten thousand feet
and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant egg nest and
and out of the wagon and onto a ship out over the ocean and oh
what a trip
rolling and tossing and splashed with the spray and Horton sat day after day after day
I am reading
