and so she would just stand there and go
there s lots of files of you just letting her go and then being like she does this all the time

Oscar is a little fish with big dreams
one day
his lucky day
he s going to be at the top of the
but until then he s working at the whale wash
Angie is Oscar s best friend
her job is to answer the phone
is whale wash you get a whale of a wash and the price oh my gosh
when Oscar gets to work
the whale wash starts thumping and the soap suds start pumping
the turtles get to work twirling on the wax when Oscar turns up the music with the volume to the max
the eels have the sparks to keep the current glowing
oh see they re lighting up so everyone can see
intensified electrified they keep the groove aflowing
the whales keep on moving through each and every station and the fish crew keeps on cleaning
while dancing in formation
that is one dirty whale huh
you re right
Angie is in the office
she twists and shakes her fins
while Gino cleans the blow hole
he slips and slides and stims
hey those look like stingrays don t they
oh
the scrubbers fall in line dancing side by side
picking up the groove and scrubbing as they glide
the crabs leap from bungee cords snapping with their claws removing all the barnacles from the whales scaly jaws
where did we see the barnacles
you re you re right on the lobster and the crab at the supermarket
mhm
inside the the whale s mouth is dirty and green and slimy
so Oscar works his magic to make it nice and shiny
bless you
bless you
Johnson is the d j way up in the booth
