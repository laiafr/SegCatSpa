let's make Tiger
we left the Play Doh out
that's right
where did the white Play Doh go Ethan
oh here it is
and this time we're gonna put the Play Doh away when we're done using it like we're not using this
let's put it back in the canister
this is like a canister
it's the container
the Play Doh container
and put the top on
can I have the blue top please
you're standing on it
under your left foot
lift your left foot up
and the red container's moving all by itself
and rocking back and forth
that's amazing

so they're holding hands
I'll hook that on you
you wanna come here
should we read your favorite story
how about the boy with a name just like yours almost
or do you want the sandwich
I think those pigs must be very hungry
all they had to eat today was ice cream
they need something nutritious
they need a sandwich
yep that's right
to help their bodies grow
very good sweetie
that's why you have to eat your food too
that's right grow and grow and grow
there ya go
either way pigs
share okay
his head is falling off
then he needs
no his feet are falling off really
you're right
his head is falling off too
the head would stay on with baking powder
maybe we'll make some cookies today
or a cake
we'll make a cake and surprise Daddy when Daddy comes home from work
there'll be a nice fresh cake for him to eat
okay
is it good
yep
that's a good lunch
maybe we'll have the same thing for lunch
would you like a sandwich
I tried to fix Piglet

you wanna make it milk color
you want your milk
I'll get your milk
where I think I put it
here's your milk
you wanna make a red cupcake
mkay
wow that's a lot of Play Doh for one little cupcake
you have to take the extra off
remember
here
let's start all over
let's start all over and cut this in half
again
here
now you smush it
oh that's
Ethan
you're really pushing hard
there
now you just need to cut the extra off
do we have the knife
you could use the knife
put it on the board okay
very good honey
yeah
you need help
here should we make it cleaner
in a hurry
shh
cut
cut
cut
cut
I'm cutting the extra off so you have a cupcake
there's your cupcake
somebody's scratching at our door
who could it be
do you know who it is
it's Dayja
what do you want now
Piglet
and Piglet
Piglet and Piglet
am I gonna share the cupcake
let me in
what kinda cupcake is it Ethan
that's Dayja
Dayja's scratching at the door
Dayja it's okay
oh
I forgot we had some ice cream too
it's a party
do you remember how old Dayja is
do you remember how many years old Dayja is
it was your favorite number
do you remember Ethan
fourteen
you making some more cupcakes
I'm gonna make a volcano
it's not really a volcano but it looks like a volcano
it's supposed to be honey
pouring out of the pot
everybody leaned over to see
uhoh train's off the track
for some reason this isn't easy to do
maybe it's a volcano of honey
see it's very hard to do isn't it
mkay
you wanna make Pooh
so Pooh can gobble all this honey up
should I make Pooh
we definitely need the yellow for that huh
yep we haven't used the yellow
you wanna open it up yourself
use all your strength
now you pull
we'll do it together
ready
here's the Pooh cookie cutter
oh sweets let's try not to do it on the bed
yeah that's good
much better
ooh
we almost sat on Pooh
I mean Piglet
did you wanna make Pooh
where's
let's see
whoa
here's the Pooh cookie cutter
whoop
you gotta push a little harder so we can make a really good Pooh
you put it down and I'll press
I'll press too
ooh
I think you did it
now take all the extra off before you pull it up
take all the extra up
all this around here yeah
you need to take the extra off
there's some more extra
there ya go
do you want me to get him out
that's the hard job
that's the hard job
I think we've got a pretty good Pooh there
his face is not quite right
maybe we didn't mush it in enough
maybe we need to use a rolling pin
the rolling pins are over there
in the box
see them over there
now I think you need to roll it on top
to push all the Play Doh in
no on top of here
so make sure all the Play Doh gets smushed down yeah
roll roll
yep that's the best one
that's the best one for this job
of course if you wanna make waffles
did you find the waffle one
falafel
that was something else we ate
you used to like falafel
we should get you some more falafel
falafel falafel
don't feel awful about your falafel
okay Ethan do you think this one might be better
because we used the rolling pin
mkay let's see
let's see here's the flat one
we call that one the waffle one
there
that's one's better
now he has a face
why don't you make Pooh a waffle
mkay
Dayja stop it
should we let Dayja in
maybe Dayja's lonely
and wants to be where somebody loves him best of all
come on in silly
just don't eat the Play Doh
sit
no Dayja
come on
sit
sit right there
sit
good dog
okay sit down
Dayja gets lonely very easily
you're gonna make a busy buzzy bee good idea
you can sit down Dayja
you made a busy buzzing bee
and Pooh would say if there's a bee around I know there must be some honey
if there's a bee around I know there must be honey
so I'm going to follow that busy buzzing bee
it flew right next to Pooh's ear that's right
should we make some honey for Pooh
this is supposed to be a honey pot
I'm gonna push down really hard
there we go
come on Pooh there's some honey for you
yeah I let Dayja in because Dayja was crying
Dayja wanted company
Dayja didn't want to be alone
I looked in but the honey pot was empty
poor Pooh
I bet it's going to rain today Ethan
poor Pooh he's gonna have to climb a honey tree or something huh
gonna ask the bee where the honey is
and what did the bee say
and the bee replied
buzz
should we make a tree out of Play Doh
we don't have the right colors for a tree but we can make a green tree
with a yellow top
you wanna make a green tree
tree trunk
and then we'll have some yellow leaves on top
you want a hole for the owl
we need a tool to make the hole in the tree
maybe the knife will do
we need an owl to go inside this little hole in the tree huh
instead of a brown bottom and a green top we need a special magical tree
but it won't stay up
there's the hole though
maybe it's where the bees live
and Pooh can reach in there and get some honey
yeah
maybe you could use the knife again
put it down on the mat
yeah
yeah that's a good idea sweetie
do you want me to help you cut it away
good job
the extra is going away now
it's getting smaller so it's almost at the bee isn't it
and so it's almost just a bumble bee now
is that good or do you want it smaller even
let's do this
it's good to take the extra off before
now you have a little bumble bee
is the hole still there
let's make the hole bigger
there's one big hole
that's where bees live and make their honey sometimes Ethan
you wanna do the volcano with this thing
where's the top
ooh let's see
there it is behind you
what color do you wanna make it this time
blue
whoop
wrong hole sweetie
different hole
yep
stick it in that hole
right
now
you stick that up
oof
it's hard to do
maybe you should put it on the ground
put it flat and then push
it's growing
oh they're joining together
yeah he's joining together to make one big river of honey
they almost look like little arms
is it coming out
yeah I see
you did it yourself
oh I thought your fingers were gonna get stuck
there's the bee Ethan
just in case
a little busy buzzing bee
buzzah
buzzah
do you wanna sit up here
drink your milk
the bee came back
oh in the story we read the bee came back
it was off the page for a long time wasn't it
it disappeared

Mommy's tires are flat
Mommy needs to pump up
to pump air in her tires
Ethan falls of his bike
Ethan rides his bike again
Ethan falls off his bike again
it's hard to learn how to ride a bike
that's why he keeps falling off
you have to balance
when you ride a two wheel bike you have to balance
and it's hard to balance
and a unicycle is even harder
Dad helps Ethan ride his bike
