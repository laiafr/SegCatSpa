I saw a very itchy cow
a cat too busy to meow
a hairy gorilla who tickly her toes

they were making their own sign
but that one's about drawing this one isn't a story
it is about drawing
do you wanna read about
let's see
Peter's chair
or
Harold circus
how about Harold circus
okay
and then we gotta find more stuff for the yard sale after this okay
Harold's circus
one evening mainly to prove to himself he could do it Harold went for a walk on a tightrope
he made sure the rope was drawn tight and straight so it wouldn't sway
he skipped lightly across and finding it fun to be a tightrope walker high about the rest of the circus
he stayed upon the rope with the greatest of ease until he lost his balance
it also is easy to fall off a tightrope
Harold fell twisting and turning with his purple crayon tight in his hands
by a stroke of luck a comfortable looking curve appeared beneath him
and he landed on an elephant's trunk
quite a trick he thought as he rewarded the elephant with a big peanut
elephants are such tall animals
Harold was still a long way from the ground
so he swung down from the elephant's trunk to the neck of a smaller animal
it was a lovely circus horse beautifully trained and Harold easily put him into a brisk trot
Harold rode with no saddle in a splendid exhibition of circus riding
at the finish of his bare back act he leapt gracefully from the horse
to his embarrassment he fell and turned a rather ridiculous somersault
before anyone could laugh at the mishap Harold pretended he had been clowning
he quickly put on a clown's hat
he put a clown's smile on his face and he acted silly like a clown
finally he took off the hat and the smile
and he gave them back to the clown
the real clown was extremely funny
and Harold laughed and laughed at him
this Harold told himself probably was the best circus he had ever seen in his life
like all circuses it had a fat lady
she was really amazingly fat
and of course there was a very tall man
he was really astoundingly tall
and next to him was a very small man
it was another man the lemonade man
he had a great tank of lemonade
Harold stopped for a drink of it through a straw
it was quite refreshing
he left some money on the counter to pay for the drink and he went on
looking for the man who was shot out of a cannon
Harold wasn't what a man who was shot out of a cannon would look like
but anyway he wasn't there
though the cannon was nearly ready
the circus can't wait
there was only one thing to do the cannon fitted Harold perfectly
he got into it and he shot out of it
he went up fast he sailed to the top of the circus where the trapezes are
and the flying rings
he reached out he caught on to a flying ring
he flung far out on it
he let go doing a startling flip flop in the air and he dived straight down
he was sure the elephant would be there to catch him again
once more a reassuring curve appeared beneath him
but he landed surprisingly hard
this was no elephant's trunk
it was the tail of a lion
somehow a lion had gotten loose in the circus
before anyone could quite recognize the danger and become alarmed
Harold was at work getting the lion into a cage
he got into the cage himself
with nothing but a lion tamer's chair
then like the bravest of lion tamers he faced the lion
with no thought of fear he put his face right in the lion's mouth
after he took his head out of the lion's mouth it occurred to him that lions had big teeth
and suddenly he became a bit frightened at how brave he had been
but his own feelings didn't matter Harold had told himself
the important thing at a circus is to make the audience happy
Harold saw that everybody in his audience wore a delighted smile
naturally making so many people happy made Harold happy
and he smiled too and very modestly he bowed
yay they all cheered for Harold
okay
I'm gonna shut this
tape off
okay want take off your backpack
okay
