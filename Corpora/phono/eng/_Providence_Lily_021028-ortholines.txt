okay
alrighty
okay which one should we read first
Paddington
do you remember what this one's called
what's this one called
Paddington's lucky day
wow
one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor gardens Mrs Brown thought she would take him out shopping
we're going to the Portobello Road explained Judy
it's a big outdoor market quite near here
you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan there's a lot to see
do you remember that I told you that Mommy and Daddy went to Portobello Road and bought something
do you remember what it was that we bought
you know the there's a little picture above your armoire in your room
it's a picture of a mommy and her little girl
and Daddy and I bought that at Portobello Road
yeah
before we even had you
because we knew we were gonna have a little Lily
yeah
Mommy might have to make some tea for herself so she doesn't cough okay
we'll finish this first though
Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
suddenly they turned a corner and Paddington found himself in what seemed like a different world
a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit vegetables people
his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in
one store was even having its picture taken
that's a new supermarket said Judy there must be something special going on there
Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the glass
perhaps I could do some shopping for you Mrs Brown he asked hopefully
Mrs Brown hesitated she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon
but Jonathan told her not to worry even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said
what goes in must come out
we can meet him by the checkout counter on our way back added Judy
Paddington felt most important as he entered the store
he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door and then consulted Mrs Brown's shopping list
everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans
there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade
he could certainly see why it was called a super market
what do you like to get at the supermarket
you like to get drinks at the supermarket
that's true we do have to get some drinks don't we we have to get some juice and some milk
what else do you like to get at the supermarket
lemonade
excellent any food that you like to get at the supermarket
even more drinks wow
that's a lot of drinks
his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he had left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming toward him pushing a large basket on wheels
may I suggest you use one of these sir he called
you can take as much as you want now he continued
can I really exclaimed Paddington
the manager nodded yes we like to make our customers happy
Paddington looked most impressed
in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure
the more Paddington saw at the supermarket the more he liked
he felt sure Mrs Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries
the other customers looked on in amazement
perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady
what's she wearing
she is wearing some glasses you're right
whoop
but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddinton with interest
since he had been in the store the manager had been joined by several other important looking men
and as Paddington reached the checkout counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap
what do you see in his basket
yeah what do you see anything that you recognize
I think I see some
right there's some chicken over there and some
right bananas
and
celery that's right that's celery
do you know what this one is here
that is actually looks just like lettuce that I think is cauliflower
right
yeah
you don't
Mommy likes cauliflower
really okay
really which cousins don't like cauliflower
oh they don't like cauliflower either
oh none of the three of you like cauliflower huh
well you're right Daddy doesn't like cauliflower
I think Auntie likes cauliflower
and Mommy likes cauliflower
great
Paddington had never been to a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy
and he gave the men a friendly wave as he unloaded his baskets
well done said the lady handing him a ticket
I hope you've brought a truck with you
there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here
Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw
hundred and fifty dollars worth he said giving the man who had said he could take as much as he wanted one of his hardest stares
he opened his suitcase and peered inside
but I've only got a nickel
yeah
what's he going to do
oh no
looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him
watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for his groceries but it was too late
with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter
Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on
all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being
she has a surprised face I think
she's going what happened
that's what she's saying
where's Paddington
because he's hiding under all the groceries
there he is
great
you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult
a prize echoed the Browns
the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall
this young bear he said happens to be our one thousandth thousandth customer today
perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply supply of groceries
all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet
even in supermarkets agreed Jonathan
Paddington sniffed the air happily
I like the Portobello Road he said I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on
yay

Mommy needs some pink medicine too

and small ones because you slept all night last night and didn't call for Mommy
yay hooray Mommy got to sleep that was great
wasn't that great
yeah
anyway I think it's nice to sleep in your bed without Mommy in it because then you have more room to yourself
yeah
right
and last last time I slept in your bed Nemo told me that he didn't have enough room to sleep
it's true
yeah he said I was taking up too much room
that's right
more room for Nemo when Mommy sleeps in her own bed
though I must say your bed is quite comfortable Honey
you're welcome Nemo
Nemo Nemo Nemo
ah
ah
ah
ah
look at those bricks

yes Honey
oh I see I see
there are the little stones you mean
yeah
there they are
a lot of the snow melted huh do you think the rest of the snow is gonna melt today

that makes it easier to drive so that's good news
oh well I don't know if we're gonna have Tamar's party since it's already past her birthday but we can have a party for you
in fact you know what you should remind Mommy today I will call Gymboree later today and maybe we can make a date for your birthday party would that be great
yeah
well I don't think Tamar is gonna have her party Honey because it's so far after her birthday now
but we'll have a party for you and Tamar can come
that will be great right
yeah
well we're not having it now because it's not your birthday yet
but your birthday is in about
what's today's date your birthday is in about four weeks or so

we bought this sweater for you when we went to Ireland
I bet you don't even remember that
that was over a year ago you were pretty little
and but we have pictures from it
you were so cute
that's right
that's right
you know what you ate a lot of when we were in Ireland
a lot of chocolate
yes we could not find very much to eat there
and when we took our big long airplane ride
this is what they gave you for lunch ready
they gave you fish and chips
which you didn't wanna eat because it was just kind of this weird fried fish
and you didn't like it
and then they gave you chocolate pudding with chocolate sprinkles
yeah you liked that
and then they gave you little chocolate M and Ms
you liked that
and then they gave you a chocolate bar too
you liked that too
so you ate all your chocolate and you were bouncing off the walls because you were so full of chocolate energy
it's true
but and you probably don't remember this but there were lots of kids on our airplane
because they were on a school trip
and they thought you were very cute and they would bring you toys
they would come and talk to you and bring you little stuffed animals to keep you happy
wasn't that nice of them
yeah
yeah
and it took us so long to get home and you slept almost not at all
it took us I think sixteen hours maybe to get home
and you slept for twenty minutes
oh you were so tired
but you didn't wanna sleep
oh my
it was ridiculous
yeah
it was ridiculous and we had lots and lots of driving to do when we were in Ireland

Franklin rides a bike
Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings
did you climb the monkey bars at school
yeah
yes that's right you were taking turns
but Franklin had a problem
he couldn't ride his bicycle without training wheels
in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
Beaver was the brave one and she took her wheels off first
she practiced and practiced
she took the training wheels off see she has no little wheels on the back
look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handlebar with the other
Franklin's training wheels are right here
oh yeah he's not his bike must be off
out of the picture
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
maybe I think you're right
right
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
he wanted to ride all by himself
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered then he fell into the flower bed
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
whoa
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
he watched as his friends rode off without him
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
there's Badger too you're right
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
I can't ride without my training wheels said Franklin
did you give it your best effort asked his mother
well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he cried
his mother held on to the seat
try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind
he felt unsteady and very unsure
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother
but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
do you think everything comes easily for him she asked
Franklin had to think about that
Franklin went to the park
he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
each time she got to the third rung she fell to the sand below
hi
whoa
whoa
no Beaver said Bear
that was so cool
I saw that that was great
