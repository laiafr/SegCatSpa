think before you do stuff please

I am the monkey king but monkeys won't obey
when I say monkeys gather round the monkeys run away
when I say sit they dance
when I say come they go
when I say monkey shake my hand
they pull my little toe
when I say kneel they jump
when I say sing they wail
when I say monkey say your prayers
they tie knots in my tail
oh I am the monkey king but I never asked to be
if monkeys have to have a king why me why me why me
who's the monkey king which one
yeah
look what they did to his tail
these all the all the monkey babies
did they run around and get in trouble
yeah
this one jumped way up high
wanna start from the beginning and see all the different poems in this book
used to love this book it's called this book is called
Moon Frog
see the froggy on the moon
animal poems
this one is ca this one over here is about a wasp
see the wasp
it says this wasp and I will not be friends until its bad behavior ends
and off it buzzes leaving me
in peace to eat my jam and tea
this one called Seven Porcupines
underneath the plum tree seven porcupines
wait to catch the ripe plums on their pointed spines
when their spines are loaded they run back to their den
there to feed there to feast
there to slurp and when
all the plums are safely stowed away in tummies
and seven porcupines have said seven yummy yummies
one by one they rattle out of their earthly den
to stand beneath the plum trees catching plums again
whatta this remind you of
who else does that
yeah who what other porcupine do we know that did that
tried to put stuff on his quills like that
remember remember one book about a porcupine
who put fruit on his quills
what was his name
mithta fun
mister fine porcupine
does he do that
okay this about the kangaroo
every time the kangaroo bounced it muttered ouch
serves it right for keeping sharpened pencils in its pouch
this one's called the Heron and Rosanna
teach me how to cycle and I'll teach you how to glide
said the heron to Rosanna by the sunny water side
impossible impossible but wait look over there
the heron on the saddle and Rosanna in the air

she's being the birdy and he's being the girl
see
this is called this is about hippos
keep well back

when seen from in the hippo's tummy
look a bird's standing right on top of the hippo's mouth
is that funny
look at all his teeth
funny teeth all over the place
this one a banana slug
don't take a banana if you picnic in the jungle
for it's in the deepest jungles that banana slugs are found
and if while you are sheltering beneath palm or banyan tree
you put your peeled banana down beside you on the ground
you might miss make a mistake
when you pick up the peeled fruit to chew
and take a careless chomp from a banana slug instead
and if you do it's true to say the taste will never go away
and even if you suck a mint
or chew peanutty bread
or lick a lolly scrub your teeth
swill onion soup or bite a peach
or try to rinse your sluggy mouth with fruit juice from a jug
your gummy gums will never let your taste buds or your tongue forget
the savor the full flavor of a fresh banana slug
see all those banana slugs
this one's called the crocodile's dentist
here's his mirror
here is his drill
here is his briefcase
here is his bill
here are his boots on the river bank
so where did the crocodile's dentist go

ah
where's the dentist
this about moon frog
the moon slid down the sky the froggy whispered soon
if only it comes close enough I'll leap unto the moon
the moon slid lower still
the froggy paused then hop
his long legs launched him at the moon and landed him on top
the moon sailed smoothly on
along its starry course
with froggy proudly riding like a jockey on a horse
he rides the moon
did you ever see a froggy who ride on the moon
you don't like that one
why not
you do like it
octopus
okay
when Ozzie octopus is sad
an easy thing to be when you are cold and lonely
at the bottom of the sea
when Ozzie octopus is glum
and far away from friends
he stretches out his wavy legs and curls them at the ends
and soon starts laughing happily
and shaking just like jelly
with all his eight legs tickling his octopusy belly

leaving wisps of wool behind like flakes of falling snow

and then took off again
and left behind its wing prints to the green
to prove that I had really seen what I had really seen

and left one hundred foot prints to show where it had been
