may be the patient would like to play rhyme time ball with her mother
or with the play lady
that s good
every body in the hospital has to wear a bracelet like that
every patient
it has the patient s birthday and patient s name on it
it s a safe thing it s about safety
so everybody can know who the patient is and how old he is
ah
be careful you re pushing the microphone
that s not so good
ah do you wanna play rhyme time ball
okay
after we play rhyme time ball with the bear Mommy has to go into the kitchen and cut broccoli up into small pieces and you could sort the silver ware for me and we can put some music on and listen to it while we are doing this things
