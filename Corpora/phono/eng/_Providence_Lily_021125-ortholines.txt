sweetie pie would you like to read a book
okay
why don't we go pick one out
yeah
let's see what we have
Franklin
okay
we should get some of your books out of the car later
sweet pea we have books in the car
alright
Franklin and the thunderstorm
honey let's not put Silly Putty in our hair
okay but we don't want it in our hair because we don't want it to get stuck
well then we'd have to cut it out or something
I know that would that's true but I still don't know if we'd be able to get it out
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
oh great
you know what
I love you
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
he could name the months of the year and all the seasons
he could read the thermometer and he checked the barometer every day
Franklin worried about the weather because he was afraid of storms
one day Franklin was supposed to play at fox's house but the sky was getting dark and the clouds were thick
maybe I shouldn't go Franklin said to his mother
she looked out the window it probably won't rain until later she said you've got time to get to fox's
Franklin put on his boots and took the umbrella
as Franklin hurried to fox's house he kept looking at the sky the clouds moved quickly and the winds swirled dirt in the air
Franklin felt all jumpy inside
fox was playing outside when Franklin arrived Franklin pointed nervously to the sky I think we should go inside don't you he asked
not yet fox grinned I love watching the clouds move and feel the wind blow it's exciting
I think it's scary said Franklin
is Franklin a lil scared
yeah
beaver snail and hawk came over to play too
my fur feels funny when it's about to storm said fox
my feathers get all ruffled said hawk beaver sniffed I can smell a storm coming
hm who do you think lives in here
oh snail lives in that little tree stump huh
I think he does
that's a cute little house for snail donchou think
mhm
the wind became stronger and hawk flew loop de loops wee he cried
Franklin held on to his hat and shivered it was almost as dark as night when big fat raindrops began to fall
we should go in shouted Franklin
no said fox follow me and they raced to the tree house where it was dry
do you think that's a good idea to go to the tree house when it's a thunder storm
no
you could get hurt in a tree house that's true
fox called his mother it's time to come in it's alright said fox we're in the tree
fox's mother was there in a second it's dangerous to be near a tree during a storm she said
lighting strikes tall things first and you might get hurt
right
you sure were right
Franklin held on to fox's mother all the way from the tree to the house they were barely in the door when there was a flash of zig zag light
lightening shrieked Franklin he trembled
thunder he screamed
that's okay Franklin said his friends we're safe here
but Franklin has crawled deep inside his shell fox's mother brought treats but still Franklin wouldn't come out
Franklin's friends begged him to play but Franklin stayed put
then with a flash and a crash the lights went out
don't worry said fox's mother she lit candles and turned on a flashlight
won't you come out now she asked Franklin
no thank you said Franklin
don't be afraid said hawk all that noise is just cloud giants playing drums in the sky
Franklin peeked out really he asked
no it's not giggled snail that noise is when the giants go bowling
Franklin came out of his shell what about lightening he asked
oh that's easy said hawk the cloud giants are turning their lights on and off
fox smiled I think it's the giants swinging from their chandeliers
Franklin laughed
giants that's ridiculous said beaver Mister Owl said that lightening is a big spark of electricity that travels from the sky to the ground
the spark is so hot it makes the air around it pop and that's the sound of thunder
amazing said Franklin
Franklin felt a little better he even played flashlight tag with his friends
soon there was hardly any lightening the thunder was a low rumble from far away and the rain stopped
then the lights when on the storms over said fox let's go outside and play
look said Franklin a rainbow
I know why the storm is over Franklin said those giants heard there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow and they've gone to find it
even beaver had to smile
wow
it sure does
look at that
should I make a lil tiny ball
okay
looks kind of like a little egg doesn't it

but then we didn't know you know auntie's friend Jason
you know he has those three dogs
we didn't know if the dogs would be at auntie's house and I know you don't like the dogs right
right
so grandma Rosie said you should either have a sleepover with Phoebe and Trevor if the dogs are not there but if the dogs are there then you could come into New York with us and have and grandma Rosie and papa Jay would watch you instead so you wouldn't have to be with the dogs
that's good huh
