we'll have to clean your hands when you're finished
try to hold it up
like this maybe
try to hold it higher if you can
oh
let's try to stay on the paper okay
honey honey you know what
these markers you're gonna ruin them
these markers aren't meant to be slammed down like that
those are the other markers
did you wanna play with those
they're different markers
did you wanna play with those
okay
oh well these
okay did you wanna
alright
I can
hold on one second I'm gonna bring this over too
these are the markers that you can slam down with not those
see these are Do A Dot art
these are the kind that you
do you wanna play with this
okay
that's orange
uhhuh
I can
it unscrews
so those are the ones
see
yes now you can
do you want me to move this w for you
alright
see
yeah
it is a circle
mhm
Mommy's gonna get you some juice
sure you can do it see
look at that you have green and orange
those are the colors of
of
some of the colors of Halloween
we meant to color the paper not our fingers right
yes it is a circle
and you know what you could put a bunch of circles
can I show with the orange what you can do
can I show you something
watch watch what Mommy does
I'm gonna put a bunch of circles together and I'm gonna make a square
okay
you ready
yes
oh boy
wow I think that's great William
okay you wanna make a square
well make a square around Mommy's
oh yeah you can fill it in
that's a good idea
yes
you did
mm
you want orange
right here
oh
blue
okay
okay
you can do it
I'm gonna be right back I'm gonna go get a face cloth
oh well you know what
how about we put the color on the paper
oh you
you wanna do finger painting
maybe that's something you and Vicky can do together
how's China
yeah
yeah
yeah
I don't know about today because I don't think we have
I have plenty of smocks for you though to wear
yeah I probably should've put one on now
but
yeah
here go ahead
this isn't really any useful
the thing to do right is it
yeah we'll put something on to protect your clothes
we can set your easel and put something underneath it and you guys you could fingerpaint
that might be a fun thing for you to do
but not with that
that's not fingerpaint honey
okay so we can get you fingerpaint
you don't
are you sure
you want
should we get you some kind of paint that you can use with brushes
now that you've colored them
okay
yeah well I could try with the face cloth
sure
I was discovering though when I was trying with the face cloth that it wasn't coming up very well
okay well what would you like to do
you wanna wash your hands
okay I think that's a good idea
can you get down from the chair
and why don't
I'll bring this chair over you can stand at the
sink and wash your hands
come on
would you like me to help you
you're
what's that
say that again
you're miserable
did you just say you're miserable
where did you get that from
who said that
who said I'm miserable
who who
yeah who used that word William
honey we're just washing our hands
we're not playing in the water right now okay
there you go
go ahead
take your hand in
yeah soap
rub your hands together
no rub your hands together
okay
this is how it works
yeah but you know what
you're not
you're rinsing all the soap off
you have to rub them together
to get the paint off
I think we might need to use the face cloth too
this isn't meant for hands
this
no
it's meant for paper
yeah and it looks like you were painting your hands too
yeah
alright
yes
okay
all done
yeah here rinse
well
it's not all gone
it's about as all gone as it's gonna be without a face cloth
it's gonna take some time
it's gonna take some time
okay
would you like to have some breakfast
you okay
you're all better
alright
yeah
that's okay you can just leave it like that
okay let go now
we're gonna get out of the sink

what are you doing you're trying to get into the cabinet
do you wanna get
there's no bottles in there William
you're not a baby anymore but there are no bottles in there
no
you're William
when you were a baby you drank a bottle
yes you did
please don't play with that
William
that is not you can't
leaning
I don't want you in there okay
you know why
you don't lean on that
okay this is not a good thing to lean on
no let go
let go
okay
I don't want you in there
I don't want you in there
what is it in there that you want
I'm gonna take your stuff out of there now
I'm taking your stuff out of there
yes it's not gonna stay in there
because I don't want you going in here
I don't want you leaning on that okay
it's not safe
it's glass and it's not meant to be leaned on
and if something broke every
all this stuff would break and you would get very hurt
okay
so that's not meant to be leaned on so please don't lean on that
okay what it is that you want in here
you're just a donkey
well what's a donkey say
haw
that's right
alright bud
you can have breakfast
I've been asking you what you want
what would you like would would you like me to make you some hot cereal
would you like some oatmeal
yeah would you like oatmeal or would you like the kind I made you yesterday
the cream of wheat
okay
okay
I'll get you the green bowl
here you go
you're welcome
would you like oatmeal in there
oatmeal with raisins
do I sound like
alright
well that it is cereal
that's a type of hot cereal
okay
what kind what kind of cereal would you like William
what kind of cereal would you like
what kind of cereal would you like
do you want the kind a made you yesterday
how about oatmeal I think oatmeal would be a nice change
oatmeal with raisins
okay well what is it that you want
yes I heard you you want cereal what is
what kind of cereal
you want cold cereal or hot cereal
okay cold cereal with milk
now what kind of
which
alright how about I bring you in and you pick one out
no we're gonna have cereal at the
do you want this one
would you want this one
this one
this one
that one
okay this one
this one
okay
I'm gonna get you milk see that
that's why I opened up the refrigerator
milk
voila
that's your vanilla milk yes it is
here's the deal the reason why I usually give you the other bowl
William I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I think I'm gonna give you a different bowl for this
okay
because this one's very light
and it'll make it a little bit more difficult for you to eat
out of
it doesn't really hold your food when you when you scoop it out
this one is a better bowl for you
because when you scoop it out
it'll stay
because it's heavier
you see
okay
yeah see it
no we don't play with bowls right
we're not gonna play with that we aren't gonna put it on our head
you like those
yes would you like some milk
is that enough milk
you're good
okay
I'll have some with you
how is that is it good
okay
oh am I Dorothy
yes William
yes what are who are you
who are you
are you William are you the Wizard of Oz are you Toto
you're the Tinman oh you're the Tinman okay
here's a napkin in case you need
you're welcome
did you have fun back at school yesterday
sounds like an airplane
oh I don't know I don't know if a truck sounds like that
it sounds a little smooth
to be a truck
maybe
but I don't think there's a snow on the ground
is there
did it snow
it did
oh
that's okay
you know what
I think I'm gonna do
I think I'm gonna move you in
it's a little difficult when you
it's on your foot
you did you got milk on your foot didn't you
milk on your foot
how's that
yeah
is that better
okay
like this
