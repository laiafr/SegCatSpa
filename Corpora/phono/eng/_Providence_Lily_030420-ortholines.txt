oh that's a good idea
yes honey
what
uhhuh
well but you know what remember last time mommy's glasses broke so I don't think I want donkey to climb on my glasses
well because we don't wanna buy yet another pair of glasses I think daddy would be unhappy if mommy bought yet another pair
I seem to go through glasses rather quickly
mhm
don't hurt me donkey
oh thanks donkey
yeah
sweets you wanna read a book
book
should we read a book
wouldjou like to pick one out
alright
we could also play dominos too if you want
wow
you'd rather read Dot
well okay
hi there my name's Dot
actually I'm princess Dot next in line to be queen of the whole ant hill
of course my sister Ada's actually queen now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time
don't get me wrong I like being a princess
but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troop then perform royal duties
and besides Ada's a good queen even though she worries a lot
she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much
when she was a queen in training she used to get upset about everything
of course there used to be a lot to get upset over
you see our ant hill used to be in a ton of trouble
there were these big mean old grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year
we were all terrified of those grasshoppers
they barely left us enough food for ourselves for the winter
poor Ada
I have to admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time
now my friend Flick he's a really cool guy
he's an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything
once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf
anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flick invented a harvesting machine
it was really neat but no one except me would listen to him and see what amazing things his machine could do
maybe if they had things would've been different
one day we heard the grasshoppers arriving so we all ran inside the ant hill Flick was left outside with his invention
I told you Flick was cool but I didn't tell you he could be kinda clumsy too
he ended up knocking the entire offering of grain over the ledge and into the river below
now we were in awfully big trouble
the grasshoppers got really mad and even picked me up and threatened to squish me
ah that's an ant's worst nightmare
ah
oh my gosh a nightmare
don't squish me
no yeah she's just a little princess ant
don't squish her
Flick felt so bad he came up with a plan to make things better
what's donkey doing
is he eating your foot
really
really
oh it looked like he was nibbling on your toe
you're right
now he has a necklace on
wow
oh it looks like a stethoscope
well
okay
he decided to leave our island to go in search of warrior bugs to protect us
no ant had ever left ant island before
good luck Flick I shouted as he flew away on a dandelion puff
nobody believed he could do it nobody expect me that is
you just watch I said
he'll get the bestest roughest bugs you've ever seen
and guess what
he did
well sort of
the only problem was that the warrior bugs Flick brought back were actually circus bugs
it was a tiny mistake but it could still work out
at least I thought it could
Flick got the circus bugs and me and my whole blueberry troop to help him with his plan
we made a giant fake bird out of leaves and twigs
so when the grasshoppers return to get their food we would scare them by crawling inside the bird and flying it right at them
it was a daring plan and Flick was great
he was like the captain of our ship
blueberries ready he asked when we were loaded inside the bird
ready we shouted back
then whoosh we were flying
and we really scared those mean old grasshoppers
they thought we were go they were going to get eaten by our bird
but then we kinduv crashed
none of us got hurt but the grasshoppers figured out what was going on
and they realized we weren't a real bird after all
but Flick was really brave he had stood up to the grasshoppers and gotten the whole colony to follow him
and Ada helped him too together they fought off the biggest meanest grasshopper of them all
in the end those mean old grasshoppers were scared away for good especially after a real live bird chased them down
in the end the only sad part was that the circus bugs had to leave
P T Flea owner of the circus asked Flick to join them too
sure you can't tour with us he asked
but Flick just said sorry my place is here
anyway the circus bugs all promised to come back and visit us at our little ant hill
and I sure hope they do
in the meantime I think Ada has a crush on Flick
I mean it's always been totally obvious that he had a crush on her but this is the first time I've seen her let him hold her hand and stuff
I guess if I have to have a brother in law Flick would be my first choice
yes
hm
anyway I've gotta go now I wanna practice my flying before supper
see ya later
