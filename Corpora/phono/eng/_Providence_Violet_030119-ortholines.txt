crab
like a suit of armor a crab shell protects it from attackers
a crab has two claws for holding and tearing food and for fighting
if a crab s claw breaks off a new one grows back
a crab s eyes are on stalks and can move in all directions
when a crab grows too big for its shell the shell splits and the and the crab climbs out of it
the crab then grows a new shell
crabs live along the coastlines in cracks and under plants
in tide pools or in burrows in sand
look at this guy
see his eyes
a crab walks quickly moving sideways
on its eight back legs
some crabs hide by covering themselves with plants and other objects
a crab s shell matches the color of the rocks plants or sand where it lives
oh that s probably why they have those piggy crabs
cause they match with the sand and the the dirt in there right
yeah
crabs measure from less than one inch across up to ten inches across
