just now it s a little
it s going to get up degrees
know what I mean baby
mhm
is at the bank yet
no
I bet he is
I don t think the banks
banks have the most ridiculous hours they still close at three o clock
on like a lot of days
one day of the week they re open until five usually
I know it s just ridiculous
they re psyched if people work at the bank
you know
they re just keeping
they re fighting it big time
they re like one of the only people
now that they have a t ms they re all set
well they have think about a bank like Citizen s
they have
they have a website that has all sorts of forms and
yeah
you can fill up your accounts and manipulate those
and stuff
yeah that s true
they ve got a twenty four hour automated or operator assisted telephone line for questions
yeah yeah
you re right
and then they ve got your a t m machines for you basic banking needs
there s a proliferation of debit slash credit cards out there to total already to go into a bank and get cash
and then they have a miniscule amount of open hours where you can talk to a real person
I think they they ve done well in everything other than that
I can only imagine what it was like fifty years ago
over the phone with David
which I thought was convenient
I wanna know what s going over on that great big house

oh yeah
one lady and the lady was taking pictures of them as they were leaving the house
always weird stuff going on over there
yeah it s just really strange
then that lady goes in there all the time
that young goes in there and comes every morning goes in

I have no idea
