I know you think so
that's kind of gross but
oh this must have been in the basement
I trying to figure out where this came from and it's the basement
William this is a little
where what William
yeah I can see that part of the reason why there's so much stuff over here is you're going down into the basement and taking bringing things up here
I don't you must be doing that with Sue
but that's really not the whole reason it's in the basement is so that it's not here
