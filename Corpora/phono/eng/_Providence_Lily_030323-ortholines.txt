so we probably
thank you sweetie
you have such a good memory
oops
oh I dropped a little blob of butter
which we havta throw away
and I ll throw our butter box away
you know what we could think about
we could think about what we should have for dinner tonight
beef stew you know what it s such a warm day and beef stew it should be colder to make beef stew because it takes a long time to make and it gets the kitchen very hot
so let s think
what else could we make something
yeah
hm
I could look in the freezer I think I might have some chicken in the freezer
what could we make with chicken
we could make a chicken salad maybe
a lettuce salad I love lettuce salad
I do daddy not as fond of lettuce salad
you re right
he could eat the chicken salad but not the lettuce salad right
yeah that s true
you re right
what else could we put if we make chicken salad what could we put in it
hm let s look in the fridge and see what we have that maybe we could put into our chicken salad
we could put
we don t have any celery
we can t put celery in
we have carrots
these green beans are not looking so good
I think I havta throw these away yup
we have apples
we have some grapes
oh thank you thank you
byebye old rotten green beans
we probably have onions
we could put onions in
let s see a little tomato pesto sauce
huh you know what might be interesting actually
let me see here
I think yeah we have oh let s see what s in here
we have a little chicken tikka sauce and I wonder if we could make a vinaigrette out of this although this sauce does not excite me so much but we could probably do that right
yeah
this sauce is not so exciting
right chicken would be good
let s see
let s go look in a couple of cookbooks and see we could do I feel like we have peanut sauce a lot
so maybe we shouldn t do peanut sauce
whada you think
right
should I get the camera
no no we re still in the kitchen
oh
I m just coming in oh no look we re in here
we re here with a bunch a cookie dough
oh and cookie dough
yeah
what are you eating
let s see
alright
let s think about this
come into the kitchen with me
we ll see if we can find anything that jogs our imagination
yeah that would be a good idea right
okay so for instance
hm sour cherry vinaigrette that s interesting huh
do you think we would like a sour cherry vinaigrette on our chicken salad
well not so sour just a cherry cherry vinaigrette do you think that would be good on our chicken salad
curry chicken salad I don t know how excited I am about that
it could be good though
curry dressing
well I don t know whada you think of curry dressing
would that be good
you put some apples and some well daddy doesn t like raisins we could put grapes
pepper
some peanuts
we don t usually have curry chicken salad that could be exciting I think right
let s see which do you think sounds better
curry chicken salad which is kind of a yellow color and we could put apples and grapes in it or do you think you would like a cherry vinaigrette
whada you think
oh I see
oh that s good to know
alright maybe we ll do that then
excuse me
goodness gracious
who s in the green room
okay
alright
here I come
ooh Fed Ex is here
I think I know what it is it s for mommy
uhoh
you know what I think it is
I think it s goat cheese that I ordered

what
alright mommy s gonna try them and I ll tell you if I think they re delicious okay and if they re delicious then maybe you ll wanna try them right

and let me get the chicken out of the freezer
okay
would that be a great idea
