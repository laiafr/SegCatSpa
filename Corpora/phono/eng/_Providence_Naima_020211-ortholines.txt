gonna make sure it s not too hot
oh it s perfect mhm
okay go ahead
yum Naima
thought I had it
are you and Richard working on it
yeah it s this trip to
oh yes I think you re right Naima
Babaji and Daddy are watching television
that s what she said she said I think but
Dadaji and Babaji are watching a movie
I forgot I had a movie
hey that was good
you re eating orzo with a very big spoon
that spoon is as big as Naima
ah let s see
well I mean the tomato sauce won t work for my dad
no I was gonna make I have some
probably olive oil and garlic or something
I have mushrooms
oh I dunno I should ask him probably about the mushrooms
and actually I ll make whole wheat pasta for us but he can have this little bit of orzo that she s having
tomato mushroom and olive I do have olives
so mushrooms are fine babe
oh good okay
what about olives
I dunno
oh you mean whole olives
yes
how bout olives
olives are okay too
okay
good
that s great
and onions garlic he can have that without restriction
yeah onions and garlic
is that good Naima
is it yummy
great
I think maybe tomorrow I will have a noncooking day for myself
and now he can t eat tofu but that is either that or the how am
well I mean he can eat small amounts
because I was gonna maybe throw in the the marinated lemony garlicky tofu into the mix
or have it on the side that way people can do what they want
an we can make a salad too
you want more orzo Naima
you do
save some for your dad if possible
oh is the whole wheat not good for him
I right he avoids whole wheat
oh that s right he eats
and you want some tomato sauce too
there
is it hot
I dunno
what s Daddy doing
just a little snacking
mm
Daddy s eating something called cashews
it s a kind of a nut
I think animals probably like cashews too
oh do you not have a pocket in these
or you probably do
no
oh well
take it off if you can
you wanna to listen to Portishead
oh you were cooling the pasta down I wondered what you were doing
you re cooling it down yourself
hm
like this
yes yes I ve seen her do that before
those azaleas outside are really nice looking
mm
one is pink and there s a red one coming in
I was thinking maybe we should all go for at least one meal we should go to like to the paddock or something
mhm I had the same thought
it might be busy though although if we went
this is a weird weekend
you want more orzo
okay
more orzo for the Boo
want more tomato sauce too
you think one of these is enough for all of us
yeah
there s twenty one
twenty one grams of protein in this whole thing that s not enough for four adults really
no
three plus fifteen
or I could fry this up
temper
yeah
that would probably be tastier especially if you threw it in with the
this salsa only has twenty one
well your dad s
oh
right he ll he ll have maybe four or five grams the rest of us will have more
no
miss Naima boo you re having a good supper
actually that s add some soy
you could switch because I did start this tape because I thought we d get your parents in here on and maybe segue into them talking about this or that so
mhm
it s okay if it s a hybrid tape I think have to be
you are having a good supper Naima I m glad to see you eating it
mm
that s the only problem with a Friday call if
if it s bad the whole next day is kinda shot

I know Naima but you know what Babaji and Dadaji are watching it

partly
so what do you have in the building
oh I don t know I mean I didn t really have
you know I try to suppress that as soon as I have the thought
so that I don t actually
something eggy
no of course something sweet
sucrose
pastry
oh I can go get that s easy
from Fancy s
yeah but you know your parents it s not so great to have it around because of them
but this I dunno you know I didn t check the hours of the new place up here
oh Naima s
I think that their other ones aren t ripe but you could have some strawberry the other ones are hard
can I get you some fresh strawberry
he s double checking
that s that s what I meant
how bout some fresh
well this one seems to fight
oh well sorry
have some strawberries honey
look don t these look good
that s a huge strawberry
okay
I think Naima s correcting herself instead of saying you she s saying Naima because she knows has a sense that you is not quite right
yeah
I m gonna
I m gonna cut it
Naima s gonna do it
you gonna take a bite of it
you could take a bite of it
you can try it
like an apple
it s as big as a little apple
small bite take a small bite
it s good for your teeth
mm
mm
Naima s eating a strawberry
the way that it s meant to be eaten
that s right
well Naima had strawberries at Gene s farm
warm from the sun just picked
mm
not washed except Mommy dusted it off
last summer last June probably
got lost did he
I know
you didn t run into deer poop
well they were
I don t think the deer actually come into the strawberry patch to poop
do you have a twenty four hour video camera
I think it was one of these things where they were right on top they were you know
here
well it s hard to to do it by hand
why don t I use the knife
to make it easier to eat okay
oh
oh you got strawberry in your eye
close your eyes for a minute and then I ll they ll feel better if you close them for a little
not not hard just lightly
you don t have to shut them that tightly look how Mommy s closing her eyes
see I m not squeezing them that s squeezing them I m just shutting them
now just close em now
as if you were asleep
yeah
here have some strawberry
what s Naima doing
are you recording
yeah
good
I m sitting across from you
Daddy s sitting across from you over here
mm
thanks for the coffee
Miss Boo Baloo
you re welcome and I d be happy to go get some
something bad
croissant
from Fancy s
well what I was gonna say is this place might actually be open on Sundays since it s different ownership
I know but
yeah I guess it s worth an extra few minutes
they had
no
on a Sunday it s hard to predict people s opening times
yup yeah
well and what what was Fancy s on Sundays
in fact weren t wasn t Fancy s closed also on Sundays
oh I drove out there and it was closed
yeah I think so
the difference was the Saturday hours
yeah you re right
I think Fancy had longer Saturday hours
you re right
but this place is unknown
oh I hate
the other thing is we could go out but that involves everybody getting ready to go out which takes too long
it s a huge production
I could make something but
and it s gonna be really crowded today
well higher bout early in the morning
there is the race today
I dunno
I don t
what race is it
it s the Johnny Kelley ten k I think
oh
and I I don t exactly remember the route but
is he gonna run in it
I think he does actually
is he your patient
no
think I think he s he may still see Mac I don t remember
I don t wanna have it because you ve been squeezing it
I will have one that you haven t been squeezing
do you wanna give me a piece that you haven t been
okay
thank you Naima
mm that s nice for sharing
are they delicious Naima are they good
the strawberries
mm wow
is it tasty Boo
squeeze it sweetie
don t squeeze it eat it
you don t wanna eat them anymore
you want some yogurt with it
okay
what could we make here that would be easy
why
oh you don t wanna mix them
you don t wanna mix up the yogurt and the strawberries
here comes the yogurt
lucky
you could doinkaboink it with Oatios or wheat if you want to
or strawberry
or both
dya want wheat or Oatios
just strawberry
how bout wheat germ
okay
I don t
no don t do that
Naima
that s making a mess
I m gonna take all the food away if you keep doing that
Naima hold still there s a strawberry down here
somewhere
just making
I have a feeling you don t like these strawberries
is that right
you don t wanna do yogurt
you didn t have any yogurt
remember this this bowl has letters on it
it s a j
baby Bjorn
spells baby Bjorn
I would actually like to get more of these bowls
and the spoons that go with em are just right too
I think they re too deep they re too much like her bowl
the spoons
the spoons or the bowl
the spoons
the ones that match that
yeah isn t it the short handle on the round
yeah
what s too deep
they re not deep
they re the same about the same as this
there was a bird at the feeder
what was he doing
he was eating some seeds
how did he know that the seeds were there
that s a good question
how did he know that the seeds were there
because we put them there maybe he saw us putting them there
that would be one way he would know
not the weeds
we planted the seeds not the weeds
we want the seeds to grow not the weeds
flowers
the weeds were flowering
you were helping me so much when we were pulling weeds down at the garden the other day
you were tugging them up yeah
you were tugging weeds
we have lots more things to plant in our garden
beans and I ordered some more seeds from a kind of a rare seed place
a french pumpkin
a french pumpkin
why
how Frenchist
a french pumpkin
how Frenchist
sorry your hair is in your yogurt on your face
some flowers
what did I order
I just kinda did it on a whim
well we have beans we need to plant
and Daddy has bachelor s buttons
oh yes bachelor s buttons
good idea
you have to find a special place for them with Daddy
yeah
you gonna make a row for them just like we made rows in the garden
you could do that
I would spare space if you wanted to have them in the vegetable garden
boy the birds are really feeding
and they re chirping
are they hungry
I think bachelor s buttons need sun right
or at least partial sun
you know what might be a good place
this area right here actually gets morning sun
yeah I know
I don t think it does all day
I know
but you could just clear out some of whatever s there and put them
this variety is tall bachelor s buttons
yeah
see how tall they are
maybe Tuesday when it s if maybe if it s not raining
drought tolerant
in the vegetable garden
we could plant them there too
early spring one to two weeks before last frost so really they should be
yeah it s it s a perfect time
yeah
seeds require dark to germinate
completely cover
mm
some some don t
okay does not transplant well
two to three foot tall that s really tall for bachelor s buttons
huh it d be interesting
no three feet is common
two to three
well you see you see them from time to time
I ve never seen bachelor s buttons that tall
mm
I have up to here
well then it s a variety for you
that ll be nice I think that would be a good place
mm
would you like some toast to eat Naima
I ll toast the toast for you
well the toaster s unplugged that s okay
I think we don t have enough maple syrup to really make
yeah we have very little in fact I keep meaning to tell you
I haven t been using it so I haven t noticed
I m looking for bread so that I can make the toast for you
there s bread in the freezer
yeah I just
I m not a big fan of bread in the freezer
why am I fanning
oh I wasn t talking about the fan
she was talking about a different kind of fan
there s a different kind of fan called a fan somebody who likes something a lot is called a fan
that s short for fanatic
oh what s the fan gonna blow out
fans blow air
but when people are fans we mean that they re fanatics
that means they really like something a lot
that means they really really really like something they re called fans
what was used to go in the house fans
the big fan
upstairs in the ceiling
oh in the old house you mean
in the old house the big noisy fan
mhm
is that what you were remembering Naima
no
oh
the plastic smell
Daddy was blowing fans out
dya want some fresh banana
okay
but I m making the toast
I m making the toast now
I do
we picked them
Naima s gonna help me plant them when the weather s a little bit better when it stops raining
yeah it s not good to really do gardening when the ground is wet because you spread things all over the place
yeah
we do need to tug up more weeds well maybe who knows maybe today it won t rain very much and maybe it will get a little dryer and maybe we can do things outside
well anyway I didn t finish telling you all the other kinds of seeds we re gonna plant
beans we have beans to plant
we need to get some poles to put the beans on
and we re
and we re gonna
at the pole store
yeah I m gonna order some from the pole store
it s not a real store it s a thing I have to buy on the computer
you can do it with me
you can do it with Mommy
yup you can do
but you have to just sit at the computer and do it
and we ll look at a picture of it and buy it
boy I m tired
I know
there is a pole at fire stations
and you slid down the pole and actually do you remember when we went with Grandma to the Museum of Science there was a play ground that had a pole and you slid down that pole too
we helped you slide down that pole
miss little firefighter girl
dya remember that play ground
it had wiggly
what did it have
wiggly turtles
no what were those
it had a wiggly seahorse
oh yeah a wiggly whale
mm
and a wiggly duck
wow
I dunno if it had a turtle did it
I think there were three two or three wiggly things
wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly
wiggly wiggly wiggly you were going back and forth from one to the other
wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly
they had things to climb on
there were other children there there were swings
well the lack of croissant on Sunday morning is an argument for moving to the city
a city
slides
Portland
it s on the train line
said it takes a long time because it stops everywhere
yeah it s a slow train at this time of year
do you remember anything else at that play ground
do you want almond butter on your toast
dya want regular butter on you toast cow cow butter
this hair situation is bugging me
you know what I m gonna put your hair up in a bun because
just like you lucky girl
because your hair is getting food in it and not that
you lucky girl you re gonna have your hair in a bun
if your hair gets food in it it will get snarls
just like we ll have to show your bun sometime
yeah
I have to go
and we could even put some chopsticks in it someday
oops
I dropped the hair
alright what would you like on your toast Naima boo
cow cow you want some cow butter
this is cow butter
she s just getting cow butter out for you boo boo
you don t want
Mommy will do it by herself
I guess she will do it by herself nobody is helping her
trying to make the toast for you
I m melting the butter onto the toast
now it s called butter toast
butter toast butter toast
butter toast
butter toast
butter toast
boy I remember that time I was sick and I was eating like massive quantities of tea n buttered toast and nothing else
where in
yes
I remember that almost more than being sick
well if I made something here it would be
the advantage is I could make it sort of pseudo healthy
why is that flashing
oh the tape s almost over how could that be
hm
dya running it at a fast speed
oh
what does that mean even
mm a couple of speed settings
I didn t know that
I think
but wait how could
I mean
but unless it was changed it should be on the default
well
the higher speed I think gives you greater fidelity allegedly I never really looked into it
I should read the manual I suppose
well we could have a whole hour on it I spose
are you eating your toast
dya want jam on it
what jam do you want on it boo boo
there s I think there s either strawberry or apricot
think that s in the door
strawberry jam for Naima coming right up
I ll take this
I m putting strawberry jam on for you
it s sticky
okay I ll put it on that one
there that has a lot of strawberry jam
that s sticky too
I guess I don t feel like cooking because the amount of dishes that ends up getting generated is just
it s like three meals a day for four people is like constant cooking and cleaning up
she s putting her own spoon in that jar so we have to
and your elbows are over toast
you could use the knife to try to get out the jam
boy that s azalea s so bright
don t you use the knife
hold onto the jar with one hand and then put the knife in
put the knife in and scoop it out
that s not how we eat jam we eat jam on toast
where did you get these
