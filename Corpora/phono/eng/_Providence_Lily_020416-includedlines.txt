*MOT:	there wasn't any moon , and Harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight . 913411_918235
*MOT:	and he needed something to walk on . 918235_920586
*MOT:	he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost . 920586_925048
*MOT:	and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him . 925048_928838
*MOT:	but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path , so he left the path for a shortcut across a field . 928838_936375
*MOT:	and the moon went with him . 936375_938040
*MOT:	the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought_to be . 938040_942598
*MOT:	he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest . 942598_947190

*MOT:	his hand holding the purple crayon shook . 982840_985303
*MOT:	suddenly , he realized what was happening , but by then , Harold was over his head in an ocean . 985303_991436
*MOT:	he drew water . 991436_993193
*MOT:	but he came up thinking fast , and in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat . 993193_999145
*MOT:	he quickly set sail . 999145_1001775
*MOT:	ooh boy , that's annoying , huh ? 1001775_1007101

*MOT:	he quickly set sail , and the moon sailed with him . 1021146_1024838
*MOT:	after he had sailed long enough , Harold made land without too much trouble . 1024838_1029676
*MOT:	he stepped ashore on the beach wondering where he was . 1029676_1032589
*MOT:	the sandy beach reminded Harold of picnics , and the thought of picnics made him hungry . 1032589_1037905

*MOT:	there was nothing but +... 1040345_1042369
*MOT:	pie .

*MOT:	when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left . 1048113_1052180
*MOT:	he hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste . 1052180_1055438
*MOT:	so he left a very hungry +... 1055438_1058020
*MOT:	moose , and a deserving +...
*MOT:	porcupine to finish it up .
*MOT:	and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was . 1063451_1067236

*MOT:	oh he's climbing up the mountain to see if he can find his bedroom .

*MOT:	he was falling into +... 1092366_1094213
*MOT:	thin air .
*MOT:	but luckily he kept his wits and his purple crayon . 1096731_1100993
*MOT:	and he made a hot air balloon and grabbed on . 1100993_1103841
*MOT:	he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in . 1103841_1107966
*MOT:	he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window . 1107966_1111800
*MOT:	he couldn't even see his house . 1111800_1113508
*MOT:	so he made a house with windows and landed the balloon on the grass in the front yard . 1113508_1119898
*MOT:	none of the windows was his window though . 1119898_1124038

*MOT:	and he couldn't think where it might be . 1146991_1149130
*MOT:	he decided to ask a policeman . 1149130_1152305
*MOT:	the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway , but Harold thanked him . 1152305_1156646
*MOT:	and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in his bed . 1156646_1161811
*MOT:	then +... 1161811_1163615
