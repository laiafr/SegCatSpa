I won't put it on you you just need to sit here next to me and I'll leave
I'll just put it right next to you
okay
come on
you don't have to you just have to sit next to me okay
right
so I have an idea
I know what you wanna do
I have an idea because I think there's a couple of things that we can do
we
we can
we can read The Very Hungry Caterpillar
we can
you know what I think I'd really like to do
you know
no you know what I'd really like to do
I'd like to do the dinosaur puzzle
don't you think that would be fun
William
I'm not watching tv
yeah but I'm not gonna watch tv
I don't wanna watch tv
I'm getting this horrible feeling that you're watching an awful lot of tv and eating and awful lot of food on the couch with Sue
because you are behaving like that is the case
and I think we need to unplug the television
that's what I think
can I help you with that
this can be a little difficult to get off
here it is
okay
it's empty
it is
so
do what
you wanna do the outside like we did the first time
you wanted to pick all the outside
we'll get all the outside pieces
see the ones that have straight lines like this
ones that have straight lines
you wanna do that
we'll pick all the ones that have
well we know that this is the bottom
alright
here let's try to
oh I know I should let you do it your way
yeah you wanna sit over here
you're gonna
you have to do the red
do you see what I'm doing
oh yes
I'm
you don't want that
well I thought we were gonna do the outside so what I'm doing is I'm taking all the pieces that have a straight
look it
I'm taking all the pieces
look look
alright
you go right ahead see if you can find something that goes with it
you'll do
I don't know
I know
let's turn all the pieces over
we'll turn them over so you can see
see
I don't know let's see what we can find
there
that looks like there's some right on that right
mm I don't know
there it looks like
I see some red on that one
oh what that
what do you think that is
maybe that's the body
hm
they look like they might match too
oh I think you're right
that's great William
yes
that's very good
you've got it
oh
is this the piece you were
that's the one you had originally right
where does it look like that red would go
yeah
you think so
where's the red on the dinosaur
yeah
I think you're right
you just need to
oh you know what
I shouldn't have done that because you can do that all by yourself
there you go
yeah
oh very good that's right
you think yeah
hm
look at patterns
look it can you
do you see that pattern on that piece that you have in your hand
you do where is it
the one you just put
picked up
right there
look at this piece
and look at this piece
is there any patterns that match
colors
no
oh
I see
oh right
I know
let's look for that pattern
green with the tan hm
oh
mhm
I know I don't know
where
where oh where could it be
there it is
oh
hm
oh yeah yeah just a little piece of it isn't it
just a little piece because it's almost the end
wonder where it could be
I don't know
I don't know
ah what d'you think about that one
I don't
you think it's by the tail though
I was thinking about the tail
you betcha
we're looking for her tail huh
oh that one
we're lookin' for we're lookin' for body
I don't know
hm
is that it
oh that does look like it would be the tail of that dinosaur doesn't it
let's see what's down here
oh well you know what
you could always look at this picture
whoops that's why I have
that's why I have the picture there
yeah that's why I have the picture there because that's a good reference when you see what it looks like you're gonna see what the picture is that you're looking for
right
well where do you
look at that picture and where do you see that
do you think that goes there
you do
there's this dinosaur right here
I don't
I don't see
I don't see this right up near this part of her body
do you
oh I don't see that
I see little front legs somewhere
I wonder where that is
that's what we need to be looking for ah
you do
it looks like that's
that
it looks like that piece
if you look at this picture right
this piece looks like it goes over this way more doesn't it
doesn't it look like it might be over here
yeah I think so I think we need to find something that's in between
I think we need to find something in between there
yeah you just have to look at all the
look at all these pieces around
do you see anything that might fit there
you do
okay well where do you
where do
where is it
yeah
okay
how would that
how does that match
I'm gonna put this overhead light on because maybe we can see better
a little bit better
yes
me
no I think you'll find it eventually
let's go on to a different part of the puzzle
how about we look at this one
let's look up here
come on I think it's fun to do it that way
look it I'll try it I'll do it
there
you think so
oh
hm you think it would go on there
look it because it looks like it's down there doesn't it
oh see how about that
mhm
yes
I know
I'm not certain that that would go there William
lemme see
look at the picture
where do you think that would fit
looks like there's lots of rock right
look at
look for that color
where do you think it looks like it matches to
you think so
that looks like that's where the body would go hm
I'm not sure that that would go there William
look at the colors
you're looking for
look it you see this is like this and it's like this
right
what is
what does that foot look like
how about the
match this color
this color it goes
this is here
well there's a little bit here but it doesn't seem to match the picture
now what about down here
does it look like maybe it could go down here
how do you think it would fit there
ah
there you go
you did it
mhm
you know what I would look at
look at the leaves
how can you line the leaves up
looks like there some leaves here
and some leaves here
see the leaves
do you think that might work
you did it
what d'you mean you can't do it it's done
now you're looking for
what d'you wanna look for now
yeah
mm what do you think would go there
look at this picture
looks like the body
right
you're gonna look like
you're gonna look for a body that looks like that
that's the
this is mostly this body part isn't it
the big
the middle part of that dinosaur
and you're gonna look for little arms
right
mhm
I don't know you'll have to look at your pieces and see what you find
look at your pieces
look at the pieces all around
you have these pieces all around on the floor
see what you can find
see what you can find
there's what
where
right here
oh
oh yeah you're right
you can do it
you've been doing it so good
I know you can do this
I need you to help mommy
can you show me how to do it
oh can you show me
oh you did it you did it
you almost had it
show me
try again
you got it
you got it William you've got it don't give up
alright high five
woohoo
oh yeah
oh okay
right there right there
that's right the tail's just behind him
oh
I don't know where is her
oh
mm I think that maybe it's time to start looking at some of these
somewhere
welcome
I think maybe that goes
do you think that might go down here
like there
right
I think that might go over that way by those flowers
well that
it just doesn't match that one
because it maybe
that's the corner
that's the corner so it's over here somewhere
that's all
I don't know if that goes there
that might not go there either
here here's another one you can try this one
and this looks like it might be part of that grouping over there
you think so
I'm not sure about that
try this one here
alright I think that's it
it might be that one yeah
the one you just hand in your hand I think that might be it
that one
you think so
you do huh
help
you think so
