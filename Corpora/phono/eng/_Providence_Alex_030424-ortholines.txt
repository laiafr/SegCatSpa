these are the houses built in straight rows that stood in the hot sun and harsh winter snows and sheltered the pilgrims who found the new land
I like that garden I wish I had a garden like that
this is the harbor marked by a huge stone where the first steps were taken
oh no

not far from the houses built in straight rows
here comes the snow

that carried the Mayflower ship in full sail
hm more pilgrims
