I wonder what s back there
do you suppose there s some books that we haven t seen in a really long time
I think you haven t maybe had enough
breakfast
but let s see what s back there

what mysterious things can I find
oh here s something
you recognize that noise
I recognize it
not you
oh that doesn t belong here
I ll show you in a second
it s like a what doesn t belong game
everything else seems to belong
but let s see what other pictures we have
oh you re gonna like this
first of all this is what I was thinking of
and this didn t belong back there did it
this is
this is about people
you might like these pictures
these are pictures of people who live in the Arctic
and look there s tents and they use reindeer
look at that
tent it s made out of animal
fur
and that little child is wearing a suit all made out of
animal skins to keep it warm
I think that s pretty interesting
and look at all the snow on the ground
about the polar bears
I think you re right
let s see
what is the date today
I think today is July tenth
and we re cleaning the car
with a toothbrush
can you believe it
are you driving
are you a car driver
oh
would you like to clean them for me
no
and the child is driving away by herself
but children don t really drive cars
do they
they do
where is she going
she going shopping
what s she going to buy this child
who s driving a car
she slept in the car
why s that
oh
her mother s right here
and the mother said yes dear
I m right here
cleaning
three year old
spilled juice off the seat
well
because we ve never cleaned this seat
and there s quite a lotta dirt where your car seat was
yeah lotsa dirt
that s actually sand isn t it
there s a whole lotta legos here
do you wanna make some medicine bottles

I wonder who will be at swim class today
Miss Susie
it s a new class so there might even be kids you know in it
signed up again
well it s a new session of the class
starting
starting today
actually starting last week I think
how can that be
driving away without a mother
why is the child sad
she doesn t enjoy driving
oh
and her mama s right here with her in the car
but the mama s right here
okay I d like you to stop doing that actually
well I m asking you to Naima

you could make a really tall medicine bottle
super tall
how many legos can you put there
okay
there s actually even more right here on the floor
a bench
for whom
oh

a niledy nose did you say
what s a niledy nose
something for nursies is it
hm

okay you re repairing it
mhm
I m gonna put your car seat back where it used to be right here
remember you used to ride in back here and you could see Mommy a different way
I m gonna put it back where it was

okay
thank you dear
well it s supposed to be for money actually
look what I found
somebody s glasses
I clean them you can put them on
cause that helps to clean them
wanna put them on
its
now I think that you re gonna need to eat something before your swim class so
we should go in very soon and get something for you to eat
what would you like
would you like some cooked egg white
I think that takes her but she s big
a big girl so she just has a teacher
and the other kids and the parent doesn t go to her class
which is what you ll do eventually
when you re ready
but today you ll go with Daddy
now would you like some scrambled egg before you go
Emma I m asking you a question
how about some
you could have some Manchego cheese
yeah cause Emma s a big girl she doesn t need a parent to be in the swim class with her
she has a different kind of swim class
the kind where the parent doesn t have to go
okay
no right now I m not looking cause I m looking at what I need to do
because
uhhuh I see that
so what are you gonna have to eat Naima
you have to have a little something
for breakfast you would
oh you re right
they re looking for seeds but there really aren t any left are there
cause we do put seeds there usually
don t we
now
Mommy needs to
find her phone
trying to think
yesterday I had it when I was in the car
oh I m not sure we re gonna have time to do that before we go to Boston
cause we ve got to go to Boston today
just gonna go look for my phone in the other room
hello
hi
well I guess I was calling to investigate
scattered and overgrown a little bit so
I m talking to Daddy honey
finish packing
well I mean at this point it s a difference of how many minutes that you would lose
yeah see that would make it
I think that s gonna make the difference of whether she actually makes it to the swim class
because for me to
she also she s just eating some
second breakfast cause she had practically nothing earlier
so
well that would make a difference
if it s only twenty minutes in terms of your work tomorrow I would get home now if you wanna do swim class
well that is a possibility
I mean I wouldn t discount that
but I
yes
you want a pancake
she wants a pancake
okay
yeah I ll get you one in the freezer
Daddy s gonna come home and go to swim class with you in a little while
she says no I don t want him to
but you know what
when saddy told you
reminded you of what
here I m gonna put you on speaker
Daddy remind Naima of all the fun things you do at swim class together
yeah
well remember we can play with the watering can
you like playing with the watering can don t you Baby oh
do you
the blue one
do you
why
you don t wanna go
it might be also that she s still hungry enough that she can t
really can t think past that
past getting fed
what
well I mean I can t put it
I mean this is what happened to me whenever that last time was
I can t get it out of the freezer
yeah
ah
let s see
you re gonna have pannie cakie
Naima
but you said you had fun there
why not
I don t really understand why
oh you have a fever
let s find that pancake
the pancake will give you energy
