just at this age kids don t really pronounce Rs or something but
yeah it s not very common
oh okay
she you re pouring some out
she says stuff sometimes we I swear I swear to God I don t know where she gets this accent from
like a Rhode Islander

okay take your little microphone
my gosh
you know what I had old G R Es that I had taken because I had previously applied to graduate school in New York
of course I didn t go so I had them to submit already thankfully
oh this one that s what a friend is
yeah there s nothing to make you feel stupid like a standardized test
yeah
I m like every time I ve ever taken like my S A Ts my G R Es everything I m like I m an English major and my math always ends up higher than my English which is not to say my math is astronomically high but I m like what happened
yeah
I was just laughing because was so hard I was like I can t
I know and I think they changed the format now actually because when I took it
okay I just wanna tell Amanda one quick thing
it used to be math verbal and analytical but I think it s different now isn t it
math math verbal and they have an essay section
jeez
I didn t do so well last time
and who judges that you know like
that comes in later they actually have a panel of people
oh
jeez
a friend is a listener who will always be there when you ve got a big secret you just hafta share
a friend is a sidekick who ll sit by your side to make you feel better when you re troubled inside
and when there s nothing to do on a wet rainy day a friend is a pal who ll come over to play
friends are just perfect for all kinds of things
like walking or talking or swinging on swings
and for watching tv a friend is the best
for cheering cartoons with and booing the rest
and then late at night a friend is just right
for telling ghost stories when you ve turned off the light
yes a friend is the best one to hop skip or run with
for playing some catch or just having fun with
they re running aren t they
yeah
you can sing and shout until your tonsils wear out
because that s what having a friend s all about
a friend is a buddy who ll come to your aid
when he thinks you need help or you might be afraid
a friend is a partner who ll stand back to back
to protect you from bullies or a monster attack
with a friend you can do what you most like to do
you can have your own hideouts in dark secret places
or spend the whole day having caterpillar races
what s that
can I see
looks like it came out of a puzzle or something
little pink circle
whoopsie sorry
a little pink circle
you can laugh you can cry you can watch cars go by
oh I missed a page
sorry or just drawing pictures of each other s faces
you can laugh you can cry you can watch cars go by
you can have a great time and not even try
a friend is a person who likes to be there
because you two make a wonderful pair
and when all s said and done a natural end is
a friend is a friend that s what a friend is
who are your friends
