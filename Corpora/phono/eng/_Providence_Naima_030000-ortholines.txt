the baby wants a diaper
kind of uncomfortable
Naima is going to be three years old tomorrow
and her mommy is going to be happy to sing happy birthday to her daughter
oh Naima
we went to all that trouble to find them
you have to wear some underwear

I think it s a silly Daddy
he was trying to make a joke
oh sweetie
they were what you wanted until Daddy said diapers
okay you can wear diapers
I don t actually care
I ll go get one
I m getting your diaper
this is from your suggestion and from your suggestion alone
oh are you a little tiny baby
do you know where Daddy was when you were born
he was looking right at you when you came out of my belly
that s where he was
mm
he was right there to say hello
he was kind of like the welcoming committee
you know what a welcoming committee is
a welcoming committee is someone or some people who say hello to someone who comes in to a new place
and when you came into the world out of the belly where it was dark there were people there to say hello
and Daddy was the first one
and I said hello Naima
I couldn t see you cause you were down far away from me
I said hello baby welcome
Daddy was the first one who saw you
and I said welcome Naima
glad to meet you
