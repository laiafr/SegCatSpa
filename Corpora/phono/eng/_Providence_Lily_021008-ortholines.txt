Mrs Bear and Sam counted cakes and there were twelve
they tucked them in bags and there were twelve red bags

of course Mrs Bear said
Mrs Bear pulled up close to the first sleepy house
here we are Sam I ll wait here and you take the cake
all by myself whispered Sam
go go go Mrs Bear put her arm around Sam
you can do it Sam
and off he went all by himself in new snow
all by himself waving a red bag and waving to Mrs Bear
all by himself taking cake to their friends
Sam left the red bag at the door
the sign on the bag said
a tasty surprise
then he ran back to the truck where his mama was waiting
I did it said Sam
of course said Mrs Bear
Mrs Bear and Sam bumped along just the two of them uphill and down up and down
at each sleepy house Mrs Bear stopped the truck
she put her arm around Sam
here I go whispered Sam
go go go Mrs Bear said
and off he went making tracks in new snow
waving a red bag and waving to Mrs Bear
leaving one tasty cake at each sleepy door all by himself
that s right there were two cakes left in two red bags
that s right
for us whispered Sam
of course said Mrs Bear
the sun was just sunning up the little white house
hello house said Sam as they went inside kicking off their boots
Mrs Bear poured cocoa in cups and they wriggled their toes in fat socks enjoying their cakes with cocoa
and as their bellies filled up they took turns telling stories
stories about a bear called Sam who takes cakes to his friends
