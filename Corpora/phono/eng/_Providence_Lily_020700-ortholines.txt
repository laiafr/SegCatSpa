and says I'm gonna make my magic stone soup and he puts a big pot of water with this stone in it
and the people are very interested so he says
well if you'd like to share my stone soup you can bring something small to put into the soup
so someone brings carrots
and someone brings celery
and someone brings onion
and someone brings barley
and they all put something yummy into the soup and it cooks and cooks with the magic stone and at the end it tastes so delicious and they all share the soup together
