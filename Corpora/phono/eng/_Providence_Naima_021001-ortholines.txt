oh you're right
that's exactly how to do it
wanna stand up and have me put it on

that was just a joke that made quite a long time ago
well you know might even use a potty most of the time like you do
well she's getting to be a bigger kid like you are
yep
here
I don't really know if using a potty
he is a little bit older than you
did you know that
is younger than you are actually
that means she's littler than you
did you know
I had something to tell you

let me just find it and put the
I'm not taking the whole thing off
and I'm gonna get it warmed up and everything
it's somewhere down here
it's very hard to find
it's a tiny little patch of dry skin somewhere down there
and you also have a little bit of dry skin on your shoulders
head shoulders knees and ankles
head shoulders knees and
knees and ankles
oh I have dry skin all over the place especially on my hands
you're gonna
giving me a Lubriderm

oh okay
let me put this on you
you can do

I don't want to spill that's all
mm okay turn it upside down
squeeze it like glue there
yeah
no that's enough
you can put some more here
you don't wanna put too much on
where's what
I don't have eczema I have dry skin
you have eczema which is not just dry skin but skin that's peeling a little bit
I on the back of my
yeah you have it here too
oh
alright a little bit more
you know you could put it on your own body
just yeah let me get a little bit more here
you have a little eczema here
does eczema have eggs in it
no it doesn't
that's about to drip
here put it on my hand
no it's the back of my hand that's really dry
what
it's alright
what's the matter
your dry skin's hurting
where
can you show me where
which hand
both hands
oh right there
oh
no I'm not gonna put more Lubriderm on it
cause it's not gonna make it better right
here how about
I'm just gonna
I'm not gonna rub
I'm just gonna try to get the Lubriderm off for you
ah
okay which side is hurting
both hands or just one hand
which which hand both
how about some ice
you do or you don't
it's not gonna be wet ice it's just gonna be that cold cold pack from the freezer
go to sleep
yeah we're gonna read two books and go to
yep that's fine
I just wanna show you
I'm not gonna put it on for you
you can try it yourself
this is something cold in the freezer
ah yeah
is it the top of your hand that hurts
okay let's try to put this on top cause it might help it feel better
it's just cold
it's a cold pack
cause
so that it wouldn't be too cold
if I put it without putting this cloth over it it would probably be too cold
well cause it just came out of the freezer
it's very cold in the freezer
does it feel cold
cold can sometimes help your skin feel better
come here I wanna look at your hand in the light for a second
I'm not gonna touch it I'm just gonna look at it
I need to look actually
I wanna see what's happening
I'm not gonna touch it
I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna touch it
I'm just looking honey
just keep still keep still keep still
ah oh
I'm sorry
yep I'm sorry
I shouldn't have
Naima is it getting better or getting worse
okay let's put on the cold pack
today is Friday today's the sixteenth
of January
see the
it's number sixteen on that calendar
and we're about to build a chicken coop
you're a child again
okay
a child holding its bear
do you want your red slippers
oh just want bare feet
okay
will you let me know if you need to use the potty
mm okay
now there's room on the table to build a chicken coop
see I moved everything off
are we gonna use some blocks for that
okay it needs to be safe
what else
how else should we build it
should it be square or round do you think
mm okay
well we'll need to have a doorway won't we
oh you're gonna make an open door for it
it's gonna be hard for the animals to get in there don't you think
well
they need a big door
the chickens need a big door don't they
oh that's a nice big door actually
mm okay
ooh I think the fox is still hiding
oh the fox is right there
let's make the fox hide until we finish making the chicken
foxes don't like to just stay around people
you could put the well over here
doesn't matter
you can have it wherever you want it
what's the horse doing up there
mm what a nice chicken coop there
mhm
to not be with strangers
mm
there's another chick over here
mm
mm they're safe in that coop
I think the fox is down there next to that toy basket
right down here on the floor
see hiding there
it's hiding pretty well if you can't see him or her
no right here
really
that's a brave fox
oh boy
I don't hear anything at all
try not to scrape that table
it's being very quiet isn't it
is it trying to get it
oh we were going to look up what a fox sounds like on the computer
I forgot
is that what it wants to say
now do you think that fox can get into that chicken coop
you know a fox who finds a chicken coop
the fox can probably smell the chickens through the walls of the chicken coop
and I bet that fox would prowl around and go around the chicken coop walking around looking for ways to get in
don't you think it can just jump in over those walls
maybe the chicken coop should have a roof
oh dear oh dear our chicken coop isn't doesn't have a roof
said Pushpa
chickens chickens oh
sometimes what a fox will do is carry an egg or maybe even a chick or a chicken off
it won't actually stay to eat it there I don't think
because it wants to run away and make sure the people don't catch it so it will carry away a chick or an egg
would you like me to make some eggs out of bees wax
yeah let's have a den for the fox
hm I was thinking we could make
lets
should we make a little river
oh
oh
but while we're not pretending Greenboro right now we can borrow it can't we
oh alright
well let's see
what do we have that we could make a fox den out of
a den might be in the root of an old tree or
what do we have here
look underneath some a pile of wood
what's my hair clip doing here
or hm
are you hiding my hair clip in there
I'm looking for my hair clip
toys
find toys in there
no
we're gonna make a den
what should the den be made out of
how about if we turn the doll cradle that's up there on the table upside down
the one that's up on that table
that one up there
I'll get it I'll get it I'll get it
we can put the baby in the bed instead
oh
that might be a good fox den if it's hidden
camouflaged in the woods let's make the forest down here
there's the forest with the trees
and then a fox den could be under there
mm foxes stay in a den during the day and they come out at night
they don't want people to see them
or other animals
they're nocturnal
foxes
well actually are they nocturnal
I think they're mostly nocturnal
that means they do
their daytime is nighttime
their daytime is our nighttime
I wonder if foxes eat fish
there're some fish here too
this is the fish that fell down
remember I made this for you the other day
no it's not
but the fox might like to go fishing and eat that fish
I think we should look up if the fox
cause it wasn't in my bra this time
it's just out here in the cold air
there's another fish over there too
a sponge
I don't know what it's doing there
oh it was pretend food
oh
so what's the fox gonna do now
I think we need to build a roof for that coop because the fox got into that chicken coop
we don't want the fox to get in there
well
cause the farmers don't want that do they
farmers want their hens and chicks to be safe
why
so that they can have more eggs
oh
oh did you bump your hand
let me see where
where does it hurt
you alright now
oh good
oh that looks pretty safe
I don't know if the fox could get in there
foxes sometimes can take down fences and things but not whole walls
I think I see one over here
okay
where is the fox
in the den
is it nighttime
you mean it's daytime
it's sleeping during the day in its den I think
and then at night it will come out
and look for chicks and chickens
so what do the farmers need to do during the day
they're gonna check the chicken coop and make sure it's safe
mm I'm making my chicks and chickens safe
but you know during the day while I'm out here I'm gonna let the chickens come out
oh okay
okay
well that's a good place for them at night but during the day when there's when there's sunlight and farmers are around and the dogs and cats and everyone's around it's safe to have the chickens come out and peck in the ground and run around
okay
okay
oh Pushpa should
what should she do here
okay
just gonna watch
Tush
Tush okay
oh mm
that's the sound it makes when it drinks water
hey there's a chick over there
a chick is loose
safe
okay
meow meow
meow meow
you want more
you've had enough food
I'm not going to bring any more food for you cat
what's she doing
oh putting more food in for the cat
okay
well she's gonna bring the food for the pigs now
here's your dish of food pigs
let me see what else I have
the food is too mushy
I think pigs like food even if it's mushy
pigs will eat almost anything
mm okay
horse food
hello
oh there's don't hide
okay this is just a couple minutes later
this is just a couple minutes later
you doing some puzzles
do it by yourself
okay
I wanna figure out
ah ha ha ha
that child whose name is
not
is his name
we left it at his house by a mistake once
he lives in Brewster
he lives there with his mommy and daddy and his little brother
brother who must be one and a half now
I remember when his little brother was born
those are the dinosaurs
do you remember what the names of those different dinosaurs are
do you remember
bray
brachiosaurus
do you remember
the word is up here
Pteranodon
that one's a
yeah stegosaurus
do you remember
yeah
Styracosaurus
you used to know what these were called
yeah this is a Styracosaurus
do you remember what this one is
you know this one
Styrachosaurus
what's this one
yes
also called Tyrannosaurus Rex
Tyrannosaurus Rex
Tyrannosaurus Rex
where
Spinosaurus
do you remember what kind that is
tri
right
oh yes
that one goes here doesn't it
Para
Para
remember
Parasaurolophus
yes
do you remember
bray
yep
yes
now it's all done
you visiting your old puzzles
you're not okay
do you wanna do one of the new
oh you wanna do that one
that's a pretty hard one
well you know there's another new one
there's the one about the farm that gave you as a Christmas present in the box
that's a new one
okay
should we dump all the pieces out
mhm
mhm
look at the picture it might help us realize
the water actually starts here
there's water from all the way from the bottom
should we separate all the pieces and mix them all up
to make it harder
sometimes it's fun to make things harder
okay
okay
here's a corner
I think that corner goes here
why don't we start out with
oh no I'm sorry
cause this is how it goes and that I think is that corner
did you know this is called an edge
this is the
this is the right edge of the puzzle and this is the left edge of the puzzle
and this is the top edge of the puzzle and this is the bottom edge of the puzzle
well where do you think sky might go
which edge do you think the sky might go at
the top edge right
this is the top edge
I would guess sky would go at the top edge of the puzzle
no it no it might go somewhere here
you might need to have something else here
should we find all the sky pieces
and then try to find
yup
well the
which is the straight part of that piece
this part is straight
so put the straight part against the straight part of the puzzle base
right
okay let's see where that one goes
does it go there
hey it does
here's some more sky
yeah
I think those are all sky pieces
is that a corner
oh you're right
that looks like a sky corner piece
I don't know
try that maybe
yeah
somewhere up here I think along the top edge
does it fit
does it
does it have a little brown piece
how many pieces are along the top edge
eight
eight
this is number eight
yeah
one two three four five six seven eight
that means there will be eight pieces along the bottom edge also
cause they will have the same number of pieces
this also looks like sky
hey
is it
does it have a straight edge that piece
hm
I see some more
let's see those two pieces have some sky
this piece has some sky
let's get all the pieces with some sky
this has a
did you say voila
voila
did Daddy teach you that word
voila
is that something you say when you do puzzles
it almost goes but it needs to have a straight edge
this is the left edge of the puzzle
so you need to have a piece that has
a straight edge
what about that one
wanna try that one
wanna try that one
mm
well that wouldn't need to have a straight
whatever goes here would need to have a straight edge
and there's no more sky
we should get some more edge pieces
hm there's a lot of edge pieces
it's an edge
it needs to be an edge piece that has some of this color water
with a straight edge
mm that's a good guess
let's see straight edges but with water
this piece has a straight edge and some water
wanna check that one out
voila
and the next piece below that would be one that has a straight edge and some ferns
one straight edge
this has one straight edge and some ferns
do you wanna check and see if that goes there
and then the next piece would have one straight edge and some tree trunk
and maybe part of the neck tree trunk and neck
are there any pieces with straight edges that have some tree trunk and some neck
I'm finding all the pieces with straight edges
this is
this has got tree trunk
straight edge and it has tree trunk
does that go I wonder
match up the straight edge of the piece with the straight edge of the puzzle
that means turn it around so that the straight edge is there
hey
oh you're right
that piece needs to be a corner
mm there must be corner pieces somewhere
can you look carefully
a corner piece is a piece that has two straight edges right
that has two straight edges there and there
mhm here you're sitting on some
yeah
okay
so we need a corner piece that has some tree trunk
I'm looking for another corner piece
oh here's a corner piece
wanna try that one
now I have a question for you
how many corner pieces does this puzzle have
when it's all done how many corner pieces would there be
right when it's all done there should be four corner pieces cause there are four corners in this rectangular puzzle
and how many do we have so far
one two three
we only need one more corner piece
so I see one and I think I'm gonna put it here cause I think it's gonna go there
hm
which part of the puzzle should we try next
hey
that fits
mhm the next piece here needs to have
what is that
is that part of an animal or part of the tree
hm
hm it needs to be a right edge piece cause this is a
hey what about that piece
oh maybe not
maybe that goes down there
that piece does it go there
hey
okay we need to find that piece
well we've done quite a bit haven't we
mm
here's an
here's what I think might be
hey good job
this might be a right edge piece
what do you think
I think this is part of an animal
so we need a right edge piece
here is an edge piece that has the same color as that
hey
oh yeah you're right
the little tip of that dino snout
and that wouldn't be an edge piece would it
that would just be a regular piece
mm look for a tiny piece of snout
oh is that a tiny piece of snout
hm I think this one
look there's the tiny piece of snout
that dinosaur looks like it's biting another dinosaur's tail
is it
no maybe not
it's just in front of that other dinosaur
I wonder if that
does this go somewhere here
no
no
I don't know maybe like there
I think this brown dinosaur might be a really big one
how about that
oh I guess I'm wrong
that doesn't go there
mm sometimes you just have to try things out
hm
hm
what about this color here
hm this is some sky in here
sky
hm
we need this dino's head don't we
I'm looking for a head piece
mm
a little bit of a mouth
I wonder whose snout that is
hey
great
now we have the rest of that dino's body
we found our mittens we have lost
I don't think that goes there though
it's not fitting
are you sitting on any pieces by the way
can you check
I see one under you there
I don't think it goes there
you're right it's the same color but you need like the little tiny back of that
ah
oh so try that one over here now
yep I think that's right
hey hey
I don't know
you need a piece with sky to go there
I'm gonna try this one
no it doesn't go
how about this piece of sky
mhm
a little bit yeah
I noticed that one was
well because the kind of wood that these are made out of it's called like pressed wood
it's called it's called like laminate pressed wood
and so moisture can get inside the wood and change the shape of the piece a tiny tiny tiny bit
does that go there
yes
you find some red to match this dinosaur's coloring there
that looks like it could be a Spinosaurus doesn't it
like the one that's in the other puzzle
actually you know what I think the back has a guide
it tells you what kind of
I'm just gonna see if that's a Spinosaurus number six
yes that's a Spinosaurus actually
and there's a brachiosaurus
which one is that one
right at the top
I think this is the brachiosaurus
brachiosaurus has a really really long curved neck
and I think this maybe goes here
mm turn it around a little
you're right
try turning it all the way around
does it go there
yes
voila
I see a bit of a grey dinosaur's neck there
do you think that might go
mm it's all affected by the humidity
it's not very humid now but it was humid this summer so
okay
gee we're about halfway almost
I think we're more than halfway done
I see something that might go there
hm looks like an edge like a bottom edge piece doesn't it
yeah try that the bottom the straight edge
yup stick that little peg right there
there
good
this is some kind of
let's see
there
hm
ya have any more sky pieces
we have a couple more places where we could put sky pieces here
mm okay
yeah I think that does go there
and one more piece with sky
maybe the one near your knee
no your right knee yeah
I think that might go there
oh but the blue sky should be at the top
yeah
hey
we finished the sky
hm maybe turn it around a little
maybe there's water that's here and there's water that's here
oh that looks right Naima
hey
okay
is this the right color
mm
mm
well there's a little bit of green there
ahhah
yes very nice
this I see like this dinosaur needs a piece and there's a leg
somebody's leg is there
and this is a tail
oh this green tail goes here
there
is that an edge piece
oh you're right
very nice
this is an edge piece
bottom edge piece
well try the next spot over here
and here's the last edge piece
we have all the edge pieces
all around the perimeter except for that one
it's affected by the humidity
now we only have two more pieces to match
hm
it has water
it might be upside down
try down there cause I see a little green there
is that upside down maybe
there
yay
yay
another one
do you wanna do this one that gave you
it's a different kind of puzzle
oh
well it is
it's a different kind of puzzle
okay
wanna take all the pieces out
I think so
let's see
yes because the farmers at the bottom are saying e i e i o
and it says Old Mcdonald's farm on the barn
Naima I would kind of like to take a shower
can you work on this puzzle without me while a take a shower
how about if I help you start it and then I go take my shower
and then you can keep working on it
what kind of accent is that
well I'll do part of it and then I'm gonna go take a shower
well you can tell if it's an edge piece cause it has a straight edge and to be able to see the horse's face right side up
the smooth
I think it's the top
I think it's a top edge
and here's a top corner
and here's the other top corner
why don't we do all the edges first and then fill in
I think that's also a top edge
and that's a right edge
this is a corner
I'd love to
can I go now
oh thank you
look at that piece over to your left with the horse
this is a corner piece
I think the horse piece might go there
you can come get me if you need me
here I'm gonna
what
I will help you
I've got to get dressed now and come and help you some more
have you got some pieces more
have you put some pieces on yourself
great
I can't wait to see what you did
you did not put the cow in
okay
so there's more for me to help with
oh good okay
by the way do you need to use the potty
