I found Daddy s really nice gloves that I think I gave Daddy last year or the year before just now
oh
look at these really nice outdoor gloves
oh yes
where were they
they were shoved in the back of that closet
and
another umbrella
oh and I got an umbrella today
from
the department of cardiac surgery
Brigham and Women s hospital
does it say something like go Brigham on it
I dunno I haven t opened it up
but the real innovation
did I ever show you this
hey that s beautiful
do you remember what this is
it says Diwali two thousand and three on it
did you see this
no

we made it at color me mime
it s a Diwali
hey
candle holder fer
I never saw that Miss Naima
and this is the present
are we gonna

I think we should
and this is the present for
Great Grandma
it s Naima s hand print
and it says
n a i m a
what does that spell
does it spell
elephant
does that spell elephant
Naima s a unusually cranky right now
you are
are you hungry
do you have a wet diaper
I just changed her because she asked me to a little while ago
I thought you were gonna help wrap presents anyway
alright
well
looking for my wrapping paper
yeah
that s what I m talking about
ooh ah just calm down
use your regular voice
and tell
what do you wanna ask
you can stomp but
just
if you want something you can use your regular voice to ask me
wasn t working
okay
there s Naima and we re gonna wrap presents
alright
this is gonna go right here
I m gonna cut you some paper
alright
you are gonna need some tape
I think so
now let s see
make sure this is gonna be the right size
let s see
oh yes that should be enough
okay
do you remember how we did it earlier today
you fold one end up and then the next end
yep
you do it yourself
this is how you do it
now fold it down
by fold you rub
rub the edge
see where my finger is
rub it with your whole hand
to make it crease
good
and then you fold this half down
and then make a crease with your hand all the way here
press down
let me show you
let
slide your hand like that
there
okay
wanna put some tape on
okay
you want another piece
I think Grandma really gonna like this present
good
here s another one
you trying to lift it up again
yeah I see
I see
I made it flat
here s another piece
okay
put a piece right here where this white part is
but so that it covers the edge of the paper
alright
now do you remember what we do next
we turn it around
and then it s time to make the triangles
there s one triangle
and now can you fold
take the corner
fold it way up
way up like that
good
you did
and then you fold the whole thing up
fold both triangles up
like that
and then you tape that part
and you attach this flap
this is like a flap isn t it
you attach the flap
to the present with the tape
and then
you turn it all the way around gently
so that this is the edge that you make the triangles on now
so let s make triangles here
one here
well let go for a sec
take the corner
bring it up to where the edge of the present inside the wrapping is
and then what do you do do you remember
you bring this edge way up
okay yeah
that s right
yeah and then tape
let me get my tape
yeah gotta hold it down
well you mostly wanna tape the flap to
the main part of the present
to the big part of the present
so that the flap stays down
yep
okay
that s on my finger isn t it
here
good
okay
you don t need too much just need enough to keep the flap down it doesn t have to be
well that s okay
that amount of sticking up is actually okay
okay
now
good job
turn it so that the tape is on the bottom
yeah that s the present for Grandma it look very nice
now I m gonna put this box together to wrap the hat and gloves for Grandma
okay
this is what
the hat I got for my mom
oh very nice
and some gloves to match
the hat is actually
it s wool but it s lined with fleece so it s not scratchy
that s very nice
yes
I hope
I hope she will wear it
and this is
these are the gloves
purple gloves
and I think what I wanna do
is
I wanna
no maybe that won t work
I guess I m gonna put the gloves inside the hat
and then
wrap it a little bit like this
and put it in the box
close up the box
and then we ll wrap the box in some wrapping paper
think I ll
tape the box just a little bit closed
to make sure it stays closed
okay can you put that tape right there
right here
right at the edge
yep and rub it
so that closes the box
now we need wrapping paper
I think we use the gold wrapping paper
since that seems to be
okay
let me see that s not big enough over there so
yep you re gonna help but let me cut the right size of paper first
oh the weather outside is frightful
there is but I m singing it in the wrong
with the wrong notes
because that s a song that I can never remember the right notes to
okay this is our piece of paper for this box
do you remember what the first thing we should do is
well the first thing we do
is we make sure the wrapping paper
the nice side of the wrapping paper the side we want to show is actually on the floor
this is the inside that no one s gonna see
the white part
and then we put our present down on the wrapping paper
and then we have to do some folding
do you remember what we do
how do we fold the paper
okay your end
you take your end of the paper
well we don t do the triangles just yet
take both
take this in one hand
and this corner in that hand and bring the
bring the paper right up here
onto the box
not triangles
just bring all the paper
right up onto the box
and that s what I m gonna do with my end also
I m holding this one down
and now I m bringing up this paper
so we re gonna cover
here s some tape
cover the box
with the paper
yep go ahead and put the tape right there that s good
and I ll put a piece there and I think we need one more little piece
right at the end
good
nope we actually don t need more there
the secret to good wrapping is not to use too much tape I think
now we re gonna make triangles
this is a box so it s a little different
our triangle s gonna look like that
and like that
now can you bring this up onto the main part of the box
pull up and then over
it s different from wrapping something flat
okay I m holding this will you put some tape
to attach it
we don t wanna cover all the edges with tape we just wanna use
a small
amount
teeny tiny pieces of tape
would you put that one over there
good okay
and I ll put one here
and now I m gonna bring it around
make some triangles on this side
give you a piece of tape
don t use it until I tell you okay
where s the triangles
and then folding it up
bringing it over
there
right on the edge and I ll put one little piece right here too
and that s done
well we have a lot more to wrap but we need to make sure we label these and and wrap them with ribbons and things so that
so that we know who they re for
because that s important too isn t it
I wonder if I put all my ribbons and other things in some strange location
I m gonna look in the closet over here
to see if the
wrapping paper and the ribbons are
somehow got over here by accident
well it s not there
oh I think that s the supper that s ready
I had a lot of ribbon
because Daddy and I
put supper in the oven to heat up
just a second boo boo
maybe I put it in here
nope I guess not
hm
well that s alright we re just gonna make a little tag for Grandma that says
Grandma
let s see maybe I ll use the pinking shears
how about
should I make a circle
as a tag
yes circle okay
and maybe a
how about if I make a
trapezoid for the
one for your picture
the tag for your picture
I bet she d like that
the one behind you is the one you wrapped
that s what this is for
so I m gonna write so that she knows who it s from it s fer
for
for
Grandma
actually I m gonna write merry Christmas from Naima okay
is that okay
merry
Christmas
from
Naima
it says for Grandma
merry Christmas
from Naima
I might add an exclamation point
okay would you like to tape that
to the top of the package there
bring your picture over
take this
you wanna tape it right on
you have two pieces one for each side
what I mean is one for each edge
you can decide where you wanna put it
decide where on the package you wanna put it
okay
here s the other one
I would put that piece there
if I were you
excellent
that s great
and this present
is from all of us
for
Mom
and then I m gonna say parentheses
Grandma
from
and then I m gonna write in parentheses and also
from and
and Naima
and then I m gonna tape that
I m gonna put my tape on a different way
I m gonna fold the tape
and make it almost like a piece of glue
so that this becomes like a sticker
now
these presents can go under the tree
wanna put them under the tree
and carry them over there
you ve got a little
thing here okay
right over
bring them over this way
let me take this Diwali thing out of the way
okay go ahead honey
and this one too
great
okay
come on back over here
are you ready to
I think I m gonna take a break from wrapping so that we can all have dinner
would you like to do that
okay
do you think that you could go down and tell Daddy that dinner is ready
let me take this off you while you do that
let s go tell Daddy that dinner is ready and I ll
wait where
it s still the twenty fourth of December
might
be bumpy
yeah bumpy was
if it s a road the opposite of flat is bumpy
the opposite of soft is hard
well what other adjectives describe things
well
rough and smooth
we did rough and smooth
how about long and short
oh long and short
long is the opposite of short
like a long time and then a short time
actually
how about easy and difficult
oh those are opposites
or or
delicious and yucky
I thought the cookies were
you liked them
sleepy bear does too
how about
flat
flat and crumpled
whole then crumbled
like the whole thing
oh hot and cold did you do that
cold
hot
cold
the opposite of warm is cool
the opposite of cool is warm
how about
curly and straight
the opposite of straight
there are many different things
the opposite of straight is
curved
windy
curly
curly I almost said curly
wavy
like a straight line and a wavy line
wavy
those are the major ones
what s the opposite of big
what do you think the opposite of big is
good
what s the opposite of blue
hm
there s no opposite of blue
how about sweet
what s the opposite of sweet
not really
well I don t know I would say sour is the opposite of sweet
oh I would ve said bitter
or bitter
well you could say that
and you could say salty
that s why it s not
well I don t think salty is the opposite of sweet
why not
because you can have something that s not salty that s unsalted but it s not necessarily sweet
huh
I think so anyway
well since there are five different tastes
I know how many tastes there are
actually six
I m aware of that
but
I m aware of that one too but
I still think sweet
I agree that either bitter or sour but I don t think that salty
I don t agree that that can be the opposite of sweet
well in India it is
okay
or
so
yeah so I
there could be
I could see
different cultures could
have various ideas about what the opposite is or whether it has one
I ll grant you that
you want a whole camel
a whole camel
yeah
you know how big camels are
they re a lot
oh you mean a camel cookie
I thought you meant a camel
you know what
you know what you can have a camel cookie but I would like you to have some fruit too
would you like some apple
alright
a lot of fruit
actually Daddy shoulda had fruit
Daddy can have fruit
well after three cookies it s sort of
no I don t think so
I don t think it s
closing the barn door
I don t really think of you
in those particular architectural terms
what Naima
Daddy ate his cookies they re
Daddy s soy cookies
oh Daddy s soy cookies they re up in the cabinet
but the
I ate some of your cookies Naima
Naima do you like the peel
yeah Naima does like the peel
ah see you didn t used to like it
well she doesn t like the peel when you cut it up like that
she likes the peel when she eats an apple
oh
whole
she likes to chomp at it that way
oh I see
well you can do what
would you like some
it s good for your teeth
and
okay well
it s fiber
okay well
how can I say no
thank you
easily
if you eat all that apple
and you re still hungry
after you eat all that apple
then you can have camel
oh I gotta get goin now
yeah
I have a lot of cleaning up to do downstairs
can you use any help down there Daddy
no
okay
hm
here s hoping
look what just came out of the oven
Naima s cookies
Naima s cookies just came out
they have to cool down
I m gonna try and look for that wrapping paper
well that would be good
well did you see what I
what is there that you can use because
the gold
is that enough
I dunno I have to look
I didn t actually look at them
because we actually have a B I G thing that
I know that s the point
I just
I think I used it when I was wrapping right before we left
so maybe it s behind the couch or something like that
ooh the old
the sleepy bear that went to Alaska
oh the new sleepy bear
mhm
Naima it s Christmas Eve
what do you think s gonna happen tomorrow
do you have any idea what s gonna happen tomorrow
are you gonna hang up a stocking
in front of the fire place
I always did that when I was a little girl
and when I woke up in the morning
my stockings would be bulging
with things
presents Mommy
yeah
presents
I think a stocking would be a good thing for Naima to hang in front of the fireplace
why the fireplace though
who comes down chimneys
come out before I
okay
I m coming out and going to work
that little nap did me a world a good
really
that s great
I am
although
I could wrap some presents
hm
well
I will look for that other wrapping paper
tomorrow some people are coming to visit us
do you remember who I said was coming to visit
are you gonna make
tissue paper art for and great grandma
would you like to do that now
later
so you think there might be some in the garage
the old old stuff
there was
at a certain point
for sure
I though you had trashed it
at that point I
I dunno
I
it s just
it s possible
oh that s it
that s who s coming
great grandma
grandma
and
and Daddy and Mommy and Naima that s who will be here tomorrow
we ll make special holiday food
we ll open presents
maybe we ll play games
yeah
I m sure she d love to play games with you tomorrow
grandma
even great grandma could play
please be careful spinning around there
that doesn t look very safe to me
if you fall off you it could really hurt
you could hurt yourself
are you wearing big kid pants
did you say
okay
so you gonna notice when you need to pee or poop
you do
let s go then
can you go by yourself
like big kid
okay
well you can finish chewing on your way there

we need a wrapping strategy
alright
hm
okay now that Daddy s downstairs I m gonna go get a present for him
that I have in the other room okay
there s sleepy bear
okay
this is a present for Daddy I don t want him to know about it
so we have to keep it secret
secret secret secret
now what did I do with the scissors
there s scissors
here s tape
okay
okay
you re going to the present wrapping place
excellent does he like to help wrap presents too
can you sit down
I
I m gonna wrap it right here so put your bottom right here
sit right here
and I ll let you help me
that bear still has bandaids on doesn t he
yeah
okay
this is Daddy s present
just because
I don t want Daddy to know
what it is
let s wrap it in some paper before he comes upstairs again
because I want it to be a secret
because it s more fun
here
you are
okay
you really need a shirt on so you can wear this mic
because I m just putting the mic on the floor and that s probably not such a good place for it
I know I ll put it right on my pants
closer to you
okay
I m gonna wrap this for Daddy
I ll let you help put the tape on okay
oh okay
okay
can you fold this edge up
fold that edge up
no not triangles yet
this way first
okay
you ve done this
fold this one down
well first we need some tape
presents are more fun if they re kept secret
well I think so anyway
well
people have opinions and that s my opinion
do you need a tissue
there s a box of tissues right there if you need one
oh it was just an itch
I see
okay
do triangles
take the corner this is the corner
and then bring the corner up right here
just bring it all the way up
like right to there
and then fold it down to make the triangle
now take this corner
fold it
right there
and then we made a big triangle here
and now we can tape it
here
good
yep
okay
you just need one
not too much tape
and then rub it after you put it on
okay that s good
this is a present from Mommy to Daddy
I need tags though
hm
well I think I might reuse this tag from last year
whose name is that
do you know
can you read that
read the letters
yep
i
can you sound it out
what does v sound like
in this case it sounds like
and then
this was
I don t know when I made this label it was a long time ago
this is a card
yes
the letter
the letter
you know what other letters begin with j
that s our letter for the day
what other letters
begin with
jammed is a good one
yep
yep that can be jammed
that s sometimes what jammed means
how about juicy
and juice
those begin with letter j
Jim
oh gym
that actually begins with g
remember g sometimes sounds like j
it s very confusing I know
I think it is
joke
Jew
yes
junior
yes
junior does
jum
jum jum isn t really a word actually
I m attaching
the card onto the present
with the ribbon and the tape like this
whoa
one day a child walked and walked and walked and walked
mm
oh that s your staff
your red staff
what time is it
oh okay
I won t use your red staff
don t unwrap the wrapping paper
are you going to have a bath tonight or a shower tomorrow morning
alright
to take a shower
alright I guess that s alright
in that case why don t we put a
some
a top
a pajama top on you now
because it s almost bedtime
if I bring one out can you put it on by yourself do you think
alright
well you can have a pajama bottom also
oh please don t rip that paper sweetie pie
please leave that alone
do you wanna put on these
pajamas by yourself
let s leave that alone now that you ve unwrapped it
because
Mommy and Daddy need
are gonna need to use it
there s your pajama
top and bottom
can you put them on yourself
me
why would I do
why would I wear just bottoms to bed
is that what he
is that what he does
really
is it not working right
do you need help
can I see
can I just look
you know what since you have big kid pants on
just put the tops on for now
don t worry about the bottoms because you re gonna have to get an
diaper on anyway before you go to sleep
unless your legs are really cold
are your legs cold right now
that s your pajama top
I don t think I ll fit in it
it can fit on you though sweetie
oh you know what
this is actually for you
I forgot that I ordered this
these are some pants for you
you wanna try them on
I hope so because I bought them for you
if they don t fit I might send them back
do you wanna try them on
why don t you try them on and see
just try them on and see if they fit
I got these for you because I thought that since you re gonna be using the potty a lot more you d like pants that are easy to get off and on
easy to pull down
especially when
for when you re in school
and you can go to the potty by yourself
yes well the teacher s always there to help you if you need help but
I thought maybe you d like pants that are easy to get off and on to go to school with
excellent job
excellent
those look very nice
yeah a lot of pants fit you
these are slightly long but that s something that Mommy can fix
in fact maybe I ll fix it soon
let me just
let me just
come here for a sec
just hold still for a sec I wanna see something
I wanna see how much I need to hem them
hem means to
bring them up
further
that s about where I m gonna hem them I guess
nice pants
you can take them off now
every day
what about
they ll need to be washed won t they
Mommy s gonna hem them and then
that s great they do fit
well hemming is
is a way of making them shorter
I think you have the right idea
you can put that top on now
good
I need some stronger
