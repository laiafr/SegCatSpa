she seems to be used to the cards and the book now so I I would do those and then bring some of the animals
oh yeah
oh we actually have these little animals
oh
and they have nonsense you know names that we've just made up
right
and they differ on where the stress is in each in each of the names
oh sure
so I would just play with her and introduce her to them and see if she can imitate the names just to see where she would put the stress on them
hm
so what I might just do is come on Thursday and run that and then on Friday we you could just do it as part of the session like I'm counting this as part of the one hour session
okay
oh sure
if that would work
you bet
she knew a lot of the cards though I was surprised

Mister Slinger was sharp as a tack
he wore artistic shirts
glasses on a chain around his neck
and he wore a different colored tie for each day of the week
he wears a suit and a tie
he wears a tie
a green tie right
green
green
who else wears a suit and tie
green
green tie
really
hm
green
instead of greetings students or good morning pupils Mister Slinger winked and said howdy
he thought desks in rows were old fashioned and boring
do you rodents thinks you think you can handle a semicircle
and he was always providing them with tasty snacks
things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy
I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lilly
me too said her friends Chester and Wilson and Victor
at home Lily pretended to be Mister Slinger
I am the teacher she told her baby brother Julius listen up
Lilly even wanted her own set of deluxe picture encyclopedias
whenever the students had free time they were permitted to go to the light bulb lab in the back of the classroom
they expressed their ideas creatively through drawing and writing
Lilly went often
she had a lot of ideas
she drew pictures of Mister Slinger and wrote stories about him too
during sharing time Lilly showed her creations to the entire class
wow said Mister Slinger
when Mister Slinger had bus duty Lilly stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus
Lilly raised her hand more than anyone in the class even if she didn't know the answer
and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers
I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lilly
excellent choice said Mister Slinger
one Monday morning Lilly came to school especially happy
she had gone shopping with her Grammy over the weekend
she had a new pair of movie star sunglasses
complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mister Slinger's
she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened
Lily wanted to show everyone
not now said Mister Slinger listen to our story
Lilly had a hard time listening
she really wanted to show everyone
what's Mister Slinger doing
he has a book what's he doing with the book
really
Lilly really really wanted to show everyone
not now said Mister Slinger
but Lilly couldn't wait
the glasses were so glittery the quarters were so shiny and the purse played such nice music not to mention how excellent it was for storing school supplies
look she whispered look everyone look what I've got
everyone looked including Mister Slinger
and he was not amused
I'll just keep your things at my desk until the end of the day he said and then you can take them home
Lilly's stomach lurched she felt like crying
that afternoon she went to the light bulb lab she was still very sad
she thought and thought and thought and then she became angry
she thought and thought and thought some more and then she became furious and drew a picture of Mister Slinger
it was not a very nice picture
right before the last bell rang she sneaked the drawing into Mister Slinger's book bag
a bag yeah
you've got a bag too and they're both purple
oh
wow that's great
purple
yes honey
yes sweetie
oh Lilly was very sad and ran all the way home
she found a nice note from Mister Slinger and some snacks in her bag and she felt very guilty
so her mother wrote a note and her father made some delicious snacks
the next morning Lilly got to school early
these are for you she said to Mister Slinger because I'm really really really really really really really really really really really really sorry
really really really really really really really sorry
no she was just plain sorry
Mister Slinger read the story and looked at the picture and sampled the snacks
oh no
wow he said
that's Mister Slinger
he's wearing a shirt what's on his shirt
some stars and some swirls too
you know what honey Mommy's very tired because someone got up at four in the morning
it's true
then she did a little performance using her bag and glasses and props
it's called an interpretive dance said Lilly
Mister Slinger joined in
throughout the rest of the day
yeah
her purse and quarters were in her desk
she looked at them often but did not disturb a soul
she ran and skipped and hopped and flew all the way home
she wanted to be a teacher
that is when she didn't want to be a dancer or a surgeon or an ambulance driver or a diva
yeah she's in the
she has a bag and she's in the bathtub that's kind of silly
