*MOT:	her siblings have_to wait a couple of hours to enjoy their bone treats but Maya is gnawing on hers after only twenty minutes . 141900_148411

*MOT:	crows like their food moistened so the brainy bird used the frisbee to scoop water out of his bath pan and carry it to his food bowl where he poured it onto his chow . 255363_267291
*MOT:	later Loki used a cup that Cole gave him . 267293_271145

*MOT:	in the wild these bears browse for their food sniffing out the fruits they like to eat and climbing trees to get them . 355391_362535
*MOT:	so the zoo+keepers drilled holes in an empty five gallon jug and filled it with apples grapes and raisins . 362536_368865
*MOT:	they strung this contraption on a pipe and mounted it on the animals' climbing apparatus . 368866_375060

*MOT:	all he had to do was wait for the food Rosie dropped as she spun the tumbler . 394058_397635
