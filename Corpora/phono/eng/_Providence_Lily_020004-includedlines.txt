*MOT:	do we like the supermarket ? 2456615_2458053
*MOT:	what do you get at the supermarket ?

*MOT:	Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the xxx , through the glass . 2463501_2471765
*MOT:	perhaps I could do some shopping for you Missus Brown he said hopefully .
*MOT:	Missus Brown hesitated . 2471765_2474410
*MOT:	she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon . 2474410_2478758
*MOT:	but Jonathan told her not to worry . 2478758_2483815
*MOT:	even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said .
*MOT:	what goes in must come out . 2483815_2485325
*MOT:	we can meet him back by the check+out counter on our way back added Judy . 2485325_2489556
*MOT:	Paddington felt most important as he entered the store .
*MOT:	he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door .
*MOT:	that's the manager . 2497701_2498875
*MOT:	what's he wearing ?

*MOT:	he could certainly see why it was called a super market . 2534530_2538481
*MOT:	his paws were soon full , and he was just beginning to wish he's left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming towards him pushing a large basket on wheels . 2538481_2546731
*MOT:	may I suggest you use one of these sir , he called . 2546731_2550216

*MOT:	Paddington looked most impressed . 2560505_2562905
*MOT:	in that case he said , I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure . 2562905_2567395
*MOT:	the more Paddington saw of the super market the more he liked it . 2567395_2571721
*MOT:	and he was sure Missus Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries . 2571721_2576278
*MOT:	uhoh . 2576278_2577361
*MOT:	Paddington thinks he can take them for free . 2577361_2579546
*MOT:	the other customers looked on in amazement . 2579546_2582385
*MOT:	perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by . 2582385_2586578
*MOT:	but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddington with interest . 2586578_2591036
*MOT:	since he had been in the sore , the manager had been joined by several other important looking men . 2591036_2595681
*MOT:	and as Paddington reached the check out counter , one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap . 2595681_2601328
*MOT:	Paddington had never been in a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy , and he gave the man a friendly wave .
*MOT:	achoo , did someone sneeze ? 2609116_2610808
*MOT:	is your nose stuffy ?
*MOT:	do you want Mommy to clean it ?

*MOT:	I hope you've brought a truck with you .
*MOT:	there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here . 2628776_2631818
*MOT:	Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw . 2631818_2635448
*MOT:	over a hundred and fifty dollars worth , he gasped . 2635448_2638808
*MOT:	but I've only got a nickel . 2638808_2641423
*MOT:	looking up , Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him . 2641423_2646961
*MOT:	watch out , cried the lady as he made a grab for the groceries . 2646961_2651425
*MOT:	but it was too late .
*MOT:	with a roar like an express train , everything began to tumble down off the counter . 2651425_2656216
*MOT:	oh no it's falling on Paddington . 2656216_2658683
*MOT:	Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered in groceries .
*MOT:	where's Paddington ? 2666550_2669608
*MOT:	there he is .
*MOT:	he was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on . 2669608_2675423
*MOT:	all in all , he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being . 2675423_2679253
*MOT:	what's that ? 2679253_2680246
*MOT:	a turkey .
*MOT:	that's right . 2682920_2684105
*MOT:	you wouldn't think , said the manager , that giving someone a prize would be so difficult .
*MOT:	a prize , echoed the Browns . 2689640_2692096
*MOT:	and the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall . 2692096_2694776
*MOT:	this young bear happens to be our thousandth customer today .
*MOT:	that's a big sign .
*MOT:	perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply of groceries . 2699551_2703240
*MOT:	xxx , all of which , said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries , only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet . 2703240_2710946
*MOT:	even in super markets . 2710946_2712793
*MOT:	Paddington sniffed the air happily . 2712793_2720921

*MOT:	hands up all those who agree . 2753610_2755441
*MOT:	Jonathan , Judy , and Missus Brown all put up their hands . 2755441_2759065
*MOT:	and Paddington raised both his paws as well , just to make sure .
*MOT:	there's a tent at the seaside , there is , we're gonna get to that , you're right . 2767110_2770511
*MOT:	everyone was very excited , and by the time they set out , the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move . 2770511_2777255
*MOT:	Paddington carefully fastened his seat+belt . 2777255_2780431
*MOT:	do you think he sits in a special car+seat like yours ? 2780431_2783031
*MOT:	yes , I think so too .
*MOT:	are we nearly there Mister Brown he asked hopefully ?
*MOT:	he's looking out the window , you're right . 2791430_2793190
*MOT:	Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear . 2793190_2795975
*MOT:	I'm afraid not , he said gloomily , we've only just left Windsor gardens and it's a very long way to the sea . 2795975_2801246
*MOT:	Mister Brown was right , it was a long journey . 2801246_2805213
*MOT:	but when they reached the seaside , the sight of the land and water soon made up for it . 2805213_2809210
*MOT:	Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car . 2809210_2812726
*MOT:	even the air had a different smell . 2812726_2814598
*MOT:	that's because it's special seaside air , said Missus Brown , it's very good for you .
*MOT:	what are those ? 2819760_2820941
*MOT:	what are those ? 2821783_2823080

*OPE:	xxx .
*MOT:	Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things . 2855318_2863198
*MOT:	I hope the air doesn't get used up , Missus Brown , he said in a loud voice .
*MOT:	and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed . 2863198_2867995
*MOT:	come on Paddington , called Judy , let's go for a swim . 2867995_2871118
*MOT:	it took Paddington quite a while to get ready . 2871118_2880383
*MOT:	he wasn't the sort of bear who believed in taking chances , and by the time he went into the sea , he was wearing so many things he promptly sank .
*MOT:	no wonder , cried Judy , you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw bands . 2880383_2885075
*MOT:	fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water , exclaimed Jonathan . 2885075_2888520
*MOT:	I thought the water might be cold , said Paddington . 2888520_2891375
*MOT:	after his paw bands had been properly blown up , Paddington went in the water again . 2891375_2896406
*MOT:	and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed . 2896406_2900440
*MOT:	oh , she's got a lollipop .
*MOT:	Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him . 2904658_2909683
*MOT:	first there was a loud cry . 2909683_2911635
*MOT:	then there were the sound of people booing . 2911635_2913281
*MOT:	they're watching Mister Briggs' Punch and Judy , explained Missus Brown . 2913281_2917131
*MOT:	Paddington jumped up +/.
*MOT:	lollipop .
*MOT:	jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears . 2920341_2923683
*MOT:	but Mister and Missus Brown seemed much too busy with the picnic things to be bothered .
*MOT:	oh who's got the ice cream cone ?
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	where's Paddington asked Jonathan when he and Judy arrived back shortly afterwards carrying ice cream cones and an ice stick . 2932408_2938208
*MOT:	I hope he's not long said Judy , I brought him a special cone . 2938208_2941456
*MOT:	he'll be most upset if it melts . 2941456_2943490
*MOT:	xxx , Jonathan glanced up and down the beach , crikey he said , look over there . 2943490_2948056
*MOT:	the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze . 2948056_2952343
*MOT:	something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent . 2952343_2956091
*MOT:	there was a large bulge on one side , and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive . 2956091_2960986
*MOT:	suddenly the tent began moving across the sand , scattering people in all directions . 2960986_2965683
*MOT:	it just missed a large sand castle , went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea . 2965683_2970505
*MOT:	quick shouted Judy , let's cut it off . 2970505_2972740
*MOT:	but it was too late . 2972740_2974051
*MOT:	Paddington , cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view . 2974051_2979096
*MOT:	what on earth are you doing ? 2979096_2982913
*MOT:	that's the second time I've had to rescue you .
*MOT:	Paddington stared at her in amazement . 2982913_2985236
*MOT:	but I went to rescue you , he said .
*MOT:	seagulls .
*MOT:	Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs . 2989241_2992650
*MOT:	Missus Brown +/.
*MOT:	seagulls .
*MOT:	Missus Brown looked at Paddington in astonishment .
*MOT:	and then her face cleared .
*MOT:	I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy , I said it was his Punch and Judy . 2998946_3004343
*MOT:	it's a puppet theater said Judy . 3004343_3006481
*MOT:	they often have them at the seaside . 3006481_3008576
*MOT:	there's one puppet called Mister Punch , and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo . 3008576_3013566
*MOT:	a lollipop .
*MOT:	if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington , it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs . 3017323_3023851
*MOT:	but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up . 3023851_3027251
*MOT:	it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time , and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show . 3027251_3033050
*MOT:	you can have a seat in the front row , he said to Paddington . 3033050_3035550
*MOT:	I expect bears do very good boos . 3035550_3038075
*MOT:	one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside . 3038075_3042230
*MOT:	but all good things come to an end , and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar . 3042230_3048741
*MOT:	I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home , he said . 3048741_3052146
