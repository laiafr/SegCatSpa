I think we have to switch another one
which one do you wanna take
the ambulance or the fire
mkay
well we only have one left right
very mixed up trucks I'm very confused

are you singing
singing the Spanish song
the one about the astronaut

through the clouds
song goes you wanna know how it goes from the beginning
spinners
I don't know what that is
I want to take a trip to the moon and travel in a rocket like an astronaut
through the space through the clouds over the deep blue sea
while the moon goes round and round my rocket will fly through the space through the clouds over the deep blue sea
while the moon goes round and round my rocket will fly and then in space full of stars I see our beautiful earth
far far away

Tinky Winky is tangled up in your
wire
in your special astronaut wire
so you can go up to space
yup
okay
what should we make a spaceship out of
we need something round
and we need a triangle shape
because usually a
astronaut a spaceship is well we could use some cardboard maybe
we'll see
let's see what supplies we have in here
supplies that's different from surprise
that's not good for making a spaceship
that would make a good top to a spaceship
that looks like the triangle top of a spaceship
now all we need is
the bottom part and I just had a piece of cardboard
where did it go
I bet it's right here
mkay we can make this round
tape it
and then attach
the funnel to it
you have the funnel
maybe like that
that looks a bit like a rocket ship
a what
a triangle
well this is kind of a triangle shape
I was pretending this was the triangle
you wanna make a different kind of triangle
should we tape this so it stays
like a circle
you could put one of your guys inside and he can blast off to outer space
I hafta fix it first I need the tape
then we'll put the triangle on top
but first I need some tape
and some scissors
you wanna put the white guy in
okay
whoops
or we could make a
sponge
maybe we could make a rocket ship out of this
I have the tape right here
what else
filled with what
well oh you should go pee pee on the potty
hm
did you miss
forget to tell mommy that
did you forget to tell mommy you needed to go to the potty
yeah it's very damp
you're very very damp

the tape is right there sweetie it's a different kind of tape
it's not a scotch tape
it's called masking tape
mm what do we wanna make out of that
mm
you made some funny
a telescope
you could make a telescope out of that
yep that's what a telescope does
do I look bigger
do I look closer
yeah magnifying glass makes things look bigger
and a telescope makes things look
closer closer
what do you see through your telescope
also bigger
yeah you're right
because if you look at a star through a telescope
it gets closer and bigger
well we have to wait til the stars come out
at night mhm
and one day when you get bigger we'll go to the planetarium
kinda like a wolf
or a dog howling at the moon
did you hear that
your car went by itself
no
did work
I think it was magic
I think it was a little bit of magic going on there
your pants are falling down
the hems are falling down
I gotta sew your pants

a digger
a digger

a plain old tow truck which means we have to find the plain old eyes right
uhoh
oop
there's the eye
mhm that's the way it goes
very good
they gotcha tow truck
he needs his hat I know
we've never found it
mkay
mhm that's the best solution to the problem
yeah he doesn't know the difference
it looks like it matches you see
mkay
a plain old fire truck
to wiggle it gently and slowly
well there are the eyes
a mouth
that looks like a mouth
mhm
mm that's a funny looking truck
a mixed up truck
it's got a spring so his head bounces
boing boing boing
that was a funny sound
that sounded like a spring that noise
mhm
okay
mkay
okay you gotta put the fire hydrant on the fire truck that's a good idea
what do you want
mhm you need some more
mhm
mhm
mkay it looks like you need one more right
what color do you want red or green
oh red and green
wow
now you need one more block
how about
you don't have a purple one
how about a purple one
that's neat I like that truck
that looks kinda like a circus truck because it's so colorful
mhm it's kind of what it looks like to me
mhm
could put that on top couldn't you
a fire circus truck
whoops
took a couple blocks there
yeah it looks like a circus truck to me
they always say that
no matter what kind of truck it is it says there's a lot of work to do
no it's not is it
we can't tell exactly what it is
it's a made up truck
it's Ethan's special made up super duper made up truck
yeah
what noise would a circus truck make
that's what noise a circus truck would make
it honked his horn
that was a good idea Ethan what you did
wiggle
into a tow truck
the tow truck parts are all here
you already did the tow truck before
mhm
yep he does
I see it right there
then he's towing something up that's the sound as this goes up in the air it goes
okay
is there another spring or just a different block yeah
those are the gauges
not on a tow truck
but it looks like a hose doesn't it
but I think it's rope
that's a new kind of tow truck
you need some of those small blocks here
mm a bunch more
there's some behind you
very good there's another one right there
there's one more
look it's a whole
well you gotta take the hat off I think
there you go
you got it
well done
that looks like a circus truck again to me
yeah
yeah circus hat
circus truck needs a crazy hat
I think the circus truck needs a silly circus hat
let's see
that's a circus truck but it has
what can we make a hat out of that's silly
you can put Pooh on the top
your Pooh puppet
that would kinda fall off let's see
I'll show you
let's see if we can put this like this
now it really looks like a circus truck to me or a Pooh truck
wee
Pooh looks like he is driving it doesn't he
maybe I know what we can do
hm
I know here
we could make him stick up in the air like this
watch this
stuff him a little
now he's stuffed and he won't collapse
he sticks straight up in the air
yeah
attach it better
there we go
mhm
okay
you pull and I'll pull
you like it when it collapses
okay
mkay
there we go stuff him
now he's all stuffed with fluff
he looks like he just ate a lot of honey
he looks pretty big and fat
mm
there that's a really interesting truck huh
just like this hm
it looks like I don't know
looks like it's the special sliding truck wee
whoops
mm
mm yep
wee
looks like he got stuck a little on the bottom there we go
mm that's why
woo
he doesn't slide so well that way does he
steady
he caught his arm on it
to unhook his arm
he is stuck
how do we get him out
we will help out
we hafta look for the other firefighter huh
the little guy
there nope
here he is
like
whoops
he's already starting to come out isn't he
he stand on his head
oh to push him down
whoa
you did it
yeah he did
like in the video

oop
now he's in the middle of the tube
mhm
let's see
whoa
grr

mhm
he was definitely stuck that time
who's gonna help him
he jumps on his head boing
because his hand is stuck
he's never gonna be unstuck
oop
sorry
now the other firefighter can help by jumping
or he can use his axe
and he can cut some of the cardboard away ksh ksh
mhm
you like it when he gets really stuck huh
no whoops here
lift the hand up
oop he's stuck already
what
a hat
or what's attached to his hat yeah
I don't know lemme see
you know they almost look like flashlights
maybe he has lights on his hat so he can go and see in dark places
does he have them too
yeah he has one

last time he had one
hm
now he has two
and you know what that is
that's his walkie talkie right there

here's a little hill that they can climb up
chug he's climbing up that steep hill
hey

wanna ride in the truck
mhm
they do have holes don't they
but I don't know if it would fit
we can try it
he has a special hole
whoops
it looks more like a fire truck like that let's see
if that
he fits on
doesn't quite fit the hole is a different size
there we go now he's on it
mm we need some hoses to put on the back and then it will be his
we could pretend this is a long hose
two hoses
okay that's a good idea here
gonna wrap it around the front part of the truck
let's see
I have an idea wrap it around here
there you have some hoses
whoops
and then
should we put together whoops
this keeps popping up
yeah when we take the dumper off it looks more like a fire truck
there's hose number two
hose number one is the red one
that's pretty funny
that looks like a siren
sometimes lights flash on a fire truck and that could be the lights flashing right
should we actually make it go
dya wanna make it go
okay I'm gonna push the button here
no it makes a noise like a truck doesn't
you have to make the sirens
whoops
his hoses fell off
and then you're
you made a funny joke
you said your fire trucks were gonna go cuckoo
that was a funny joke
I thought it was a good idea
I can't make it go at all
maybe it's not properly on a track
hm
uhoh

rushing to the fire
