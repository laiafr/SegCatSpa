I don't see you using the potty
that's the funniest thing I've ever heard
you're gonna go sit on the potty
okay
I only had one
I only had one hat
but now I have three
the very next morning Mrs Mctats woke early
she stopped to pet Abner and Basil and
Curly
hats instead of cats
does she have a lot of hats
I see
to market to market I mustn't be late
this chicken I think will surely taste
great
but when she came home there came a scratch on the door and in walked three
hats
you made a mistake
didn't we say everybody makes mistakes Naima
Mommy makes mistakes Daddy makes mistakes and Naima just made a mistake
and in walked three
hats

I think I've got room for just three more
hats

the very next morning off went Mrs Mctats
what can I buy for my six hungry
hats
I've got it she said I'll make a nice
stew
so she carried home beef and liver to brew
but back at home there came a scratch on the door and in walked four
was there room for four more
let's see
come in my sweet dears said Mrs Mctats
I know there's a place for just four more
cats

the very next day off went Mrs Mctats
what can I possibly feed fifteen
hats
she chose a fresh tuna
she chose a fine trout
but when she got home her cats
her hats

more than twenty five
who was the one who was next to arrive

I'm figuring out what's there
I guess it's sand
well I don't know what it was
why
well I think
I don't know what it was
it was
something whitish anyway
sand can be white sometimes
did you have fun playing at the beach
Lauren
you mean Ally
her
that little girl's name was Ally
that's not the same person that we saw last year whose name was Lauren
actually we should have asked Ben and Sonya if they
Lauren was the big girl
'cause they're signed in at eight twenty nine
that could
they maybe left that day
you never know
or maybe that's the day they came
'cause we didn't sign in the day we came either
hey let's put these pants on
'cause we're gonna wear them when we go
what is that
what on earth is that stain
and that stain
are they blueberry stains
I think they're blueberry stains
I think these pants belong to a bear
I can tell because they have blueberry stains on them
you're gonna find a what shirt
well actually you have a white shirt to wear today
we don't have any blue shirts with us I don't think
you know what you should say when someone sneezes
what do you say when someone sneezes
you say
gesundheit
no
why not
isn't that what I say when you sneeze
gesundheit
you used to say gesundheit
I think it was easier for you to say than gesundheit
you wanna sit up and I'll put this on
I thought
I always thought that was a funny thing to say
gesundheit
gesundheit
gesundheit
yes you're right
gesundheit
you're saying gesundheit
gesundheit
stick your arm all the way in that sleeve please
did you
when did you get a blue shirt
oh you went to someone's house by yourself and you got a blue shirt
oh
did you borrow it or did you buy it
you borrowed it
oh
d'you wanna put your socks on and pick blueberries
where are the purple socks
oh look in the bathroom
'cause I think they're in there
you wore them
you took them off in the bathroom
bring the shoes and socks in here
nap time for you
you need the shoes too
oh okay
okay
let's put these on
you must be a bear because you have a blueberry stain on your pants
only a little bear would have blueberry stain on her pants
well 'cause bears like blueberries
you know what else bears eat don't you
salmon blueberries
yep
they do
they do
mhm
they go up into the trees to find the honey
is that bothering you
i wonder why
that's pretty nutty
nutty
it's not nutty
you know what nutty means
nutty means silly
gesundheit
you want help with that
gesundheit is the right way to say it
mhm
need help
it's hard to do
stick out your foot over here
from breakfast
little bears just eat blueberries without thinking about whether they're making their clothes dirty
'cause little bears just like to eat blueberries
naked fur
like little bears
you wanna take that off now
alright
I'll do it
okay
okay
looking for Kieran
do you think he's out there
I think Kieran went somewhere else for a while
they went to visit someone else
they went to visit somebody else for a while
they didn't
why don't you
either you or I use the calling card and the phone downstairs to
call Gramps' Farm
okay I'll do that
we have
you have their number
no I don't you're gonna have to call information
okay well I might have it in my
did I have it in my palm last year or
I don't know
if I did then I'll have it in my phone
I really don't know
you have the keys
no I have the keys
let's not scare each other with
I hope you don't have 'em in those pockets that you keep losing stuff out of
you wanna go pick
I'll take her to the blueberry patch
alright
I'm gonna go too
okay
very good blueberries I hear
well I'm afraid that the Gramps' thing is not gonna happen if we don't give them enough notice
oh I'll give 'em a call
I'm going to
okay
okay
that's a good idea
you mean just like the bear in Blueberries for Sal
I'm gonna eat some tuna now
Daddy's gonna eat some tuna first
Daddy's gonna make a phone call
how many do you want
they come in five pound bags last year we got three
I don't know that we can fit more than that in that cooler
no we don't need more
definitely three
okay
and remember we have to pay cash for them
oh no you have your check book

everyday at this life
oh
like this
I thought so
it is a lego base plate
you're absolutely correct
oops
absolutely correct about that
Naima do you know what leather is
leather is a material that
it's the material that Paddington's suitcase is made out of
leather is another type of material
don't
well I wouldn't mind going and getting a little ice cream
'cause we're in New England and New Englanders eat the most ice cream of anybody
in America
I guess we like ice cream
I think there's some soft ice cream down the road
is that right where
at that place where we
oh
had it last year
oh at the entrance to Birch Harbor
correct
it is Labor Day though
they could be closed
they could be
it's higher
oh
it's higher than most of them have been
which animal
who's gonna sit on the tall thing
she wants to moma her mother

trying to fix them
I can see that
I'm gonna see if there are any more legos in the toy bag 'cause some might have gone
gotten in here
oh yep there's a thing or two in here
that doll
that panda
that polar bear
they both have the same name Naima
ah
hey y'know we should do some textures around this place
I bet some of the leaves and flowers would have good textures
maybe in a little while we could go outside and find things with textures
and this rug I bet has texture too
what's a moma
I don't know what
what's a moma Naima
you do
I don't know what a moma is
but I don't know
I don't know what a moma is

does anyone want a carrot
oh
I don't know
who will you want to pretend is a rabbit
that elephant
a gray rabbit
mhm
oh
oh
mhm
are pandas water bears
well I don't think they live in the water but they might drink from water
they might drink from streams
oh she wants to go to the play ground
do you see what I made there for you
it's a stream
it's a stream
the animals can drink out of it
it's a body of water
and here's another body of water
would you like it

mhm
that's Lauren
that's her name
ah
Lauren is taking a bath
Ally

it's on record
Naima
I don't listen to whining
I only hear things said in a regular voice
yeah
I don't know but let's find out
well I do
because you know why
you were
you've been having a rash on your bottom
so it would be better if you have a dry diaper
let's check
if it's dry then we won't change you
come here my
just a little bit
okay
would you like to sit on the potty to pee more

how 'bout big kid pants
okay lemme get a good pair
alright
here's some big kid pants
you were gonna use the potty
no that was a pretty wet diaper
I think she's probably peed out think she's got
but if you have more pee in your body you really should sit on the potty a little longer
wanna sit on the potty
you don't wanna get the big kid pants wet do you
that wouldn't be a very good idea
it is
y'know next time you need to pee you can say Mommy I think I have pee pee coming
