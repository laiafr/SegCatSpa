this is still March first
bunny cakes
oh here's some pictures of things
what do you see
yeah those are eggs
let's count those eggs
good counting Naima
one two three four five six eggs
that is a spoon
do you see where the mixer is
does that look like Mommy's mixer
it's Ruby's yeah that one is Ruby's mixer
oh cause there's two pictures here
I see the butter I thought Ruby uses butter to make the cake
I think that's the butter
yeah rubber spatula
I think Ruby uses the rubber spatula to mix the cake
and she also uses
the whisk
and oh there's the flour what's the flour in
in a red bag isn't it
with a number two on it
and I see some measuring spoons
and a measuring cup
Mommy has a cup like that
okay bunny cakes
it was grandma's birthday Max made her an earth worm what
no Max said Max's sister Ruby we're gonna make Grandma an angel surprise cake with raspberry fluff icing
what's he doing there
it looks like he's using a metal spatula to mix his cake
which is really just made out of dirt
that's actually dirt he's pretending to make a cake out of dirt
okay
Max wanted to help
don't touch anything Max said Ruby
you think she does I think he does want to help Ruby
does she want him to help
I don't think she wants him to help
you think he's gonna touch the eggs
he might what's Ruby doing with that egg
she's breaking it into the mixer
mixing bowl actually she's breaking it into the mixing bowl
she's holding on to the shells and letting the egg white and the egg yoke going into the bowl
what she making do you remember
yeah
but it was too late oops what happened
he broke the eggs
well you can't really fix eggs once you break them
you have to throw if you break them and they go on the floor you have to throw them in the garbage
maybe maybe Ruby will help Max clean that up and put it in the garbage
maybe they'll do it together you think so
yeah maybe Max and Ruby will do that
Ruby send Max to the store with a list that said
eggs
Max waned red hot marshmallow squirters
for his earth worm cake so he wrote red hot marshmallow squirters on the list
he wrote it with a red crayon except he's a little bunny and he doesn't really know how to write
he can't write he's a bunny but he's trying he's trying to write he wants to add red hot marshmallows squirters to the list so the grocer will give them to him
that's a kind of candy
the grocer could not read Max's writing
eggs said the grocer and he gave Max eggs
Max brought the eggs home to Ruby
oh I think they're in that red box
don't bump the table Max but it was too late
what happened
he spilled the milk
yeah
she said don't bump the table Max but he did bump the table you see he's bumping into it right there and the milk bottle is falling over the milk is going on to the floor
oh oh who do you think is gonna clean that up
I think she's going to ask Max to help her clean it up don't you think
when you make a mess you should help clean it up right
Ruby sent Max back to the store with a list that said
milk how do you spell milk
right
great m i l k spells milk very good Naima
this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in a different way
he really wants that candy
Max hoped and hoped for his squirters but the grocer still couldn't read Max's writing milk said the grocer and he gave Max milk
what else is the grocer selling there
yeah
and what about over there
I think those are crackers
yeah
Max brought the milk home to Ruby
what did she do Naima
what did she draw
she drew a yellow line on the floor next to the table
there's a yellow line on the floor Max said Ruby
you can't step over that line
I think she's a little bit mad
he's bringing her the milk
but Max
he crossed over the line
oops what happened
what did he do
did he spill
he spilled the flour
oh oh over went the flour
Ruby got out her pencil and she
over with the flour clonk
Ruby got out her pencil
what did she write
she wrote flour how do you spell flour
f l o u r
flour
this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in the most beautiful writing he knew
he's using a crayon isn't he
Max could almost taste the marshmallows squirters
flour said the grocer and he gave Max flour
oh I think Max might be unhappy
that's the grocer
the grocer doesn't know that Max wants the candy because he can't read what Max wrote on the list
Max is just a little guy he doesn't really know how to write or talk properly
that's the door to the kitchen
these are trees over here and that's the door to the kitchen and there's Ruby inside holding a spoon
when Max got home there was a sign on the kitchen door
Max this kitchen is no place for you said Ruby
Ruby finished up her cake whose ears do you see outside the window
those are Max's ears
Ruby won't let him into the kitchen
he's outside looking in yeah
Ruby finished up her cake she baked it and cooled it and iced it with raspberry fluff frosting
she's using something to put the frosting on the cake
oh she gave him a spoon of the icing
he's eating some of the icing just a little spoon full
he's trying just a little bit
he's outside the window looking in
she's using a knife to put the frosting on the cake
that's a very pink cake
it needs something else Max said Ruby
birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses wrote Ruby
mean while Max had a brand new idea
he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters on Ruby's list and ran to the grocer
what's he pulling behind him
yeah it's a red wagon there
maybe he's going to carry the food from the grocery store in the wagon when he goes home
what does the list say
it says birthday candles silver
sugar
and butter cream
and what're those
he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters
on Ruby's list and ran to the grocer he could not wait
well he won't have to wait too long
birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses said the grocer what's this why it must be a red hot marshmallow
squirters
Ruby's cake looked just beautiful
Max went out and put caterpillar icing on his birthday cake
on his on his earth worm cake
what's he doing what's he having in his hand
what's he doing with the knife
he's putting caterpillar icing on the cake with his knife
Grandma was so thrilled she didn't know which cake to eat first
how many cakes does she have
right she has two cakes very good
that's the end I think
do you wanna read another book
you wanna read Bunny Money
you wanna read it to Mommy
oh I have to read it to you okay
maybe we read it together
what does Ruby have
what's in her wallet
oh what're they going to do now
they gonna go on the bus
yes I think they're gonna go to the store
Ruby took a dollar from her wallet to pay the bus fair who's she giving the money to
the bus driver
oh here they're at the store do you know what the store is called
Roselinda's gift shop
in the window was a music box with skating ballerinas
isn't it beautiful Max said Ruby
thirsty said Max
you may buy a very very small lemonade Max said Ruby what's she giving him now
she's giving him her wallet do you think that's a good idea
next door in Candy's corner window were hundreds of vampire teeth
Max knew grandma would love a set of teeth with oozing cherry syrup inside for her birthday
okay
he bought them instead of the lemonade
two dollars please said Candy
Max wanted to make sure the teeth worked he put them in the teeth worked perfectly and Ruby had to take Max to the laundromat what're they gonna do with the laundromat
what're they gonna do what's this
a washing machine
and what's Ruby doing over here this is Max
this is Ruby's hand
I think Ruby is cleaning off his face with a washcloth
because he has mess on his face
soap cost a dollar the washer cost a dollar and the dryer cost another dollar
money down the drain Max said Ruby
hungry said Max
it was lunch time
Max finished off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich two coconut cup cakes and a banana shake lunch costs four dollars one two three four
what does she have left in her wallet
yeah
money is running through our fingers Max said Ruby
they walked all the way back to Roselinda's gift shop without spending another penny
oh now what's happening in this picture
well Roselinda is telling Ruby that the music box costs a hundred dollars
but she doesn't have that much she only has a five dollar bill
and Roselinda shows her the blue bird earrings that play oh what a beautiful morning
they are on sale for four dollars
we'll take them said Ruby she's gonna buy those earrings for her grandma
she gave Roselinda the five dollar bill for blue bird earrings that looked like that and went to put pick out the wrapping paper
hey what's in the wallet now
it's empty
four dollars for the earrings one dollar
it is the wallet is empty there's no more money in it
Roselinda gives Max the change you take care of this dollar young man
where's she putting that dollar
in his overalls pocket
he has a pocket right in front of his overalls
then Max goes back to Candy's corner glow in the dark vampire teeth were half price
most people like glow in the dark vampire teeth much better than the oozing cherry kind said Candy
Max bought a set for one dollar
oh no Max said Ruby you've spend our last dollar
how are we going to pay for the bus home
oh she's upset I think she's not happy
Max is happy
what's he carrying there
who're they for
what's he going to do with the presents
is he gonna give them to somebody
who's birthday is it
Grandma
ah Ruby is calling Grandma on the telephone
