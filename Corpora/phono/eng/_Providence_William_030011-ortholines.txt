and we have these special hats huh
all of these hats you have

where's that
do you know where the ball is that goes with this
this is the one that we can play in the house
do you know where the ball is
you do
where is it
oh you want me to wear this one
this one I think's for William but I'll wear it
where's the ball
well there's that ball yes but we need a
a soft ball because we're
because we're in the house
we don't play with most of the balls in the house
it is huh
that's where it goes
is that a baseball birthday hat
Spiderman Spiderman Spiderman
oh yes
that is
yes it is I'm looking in these bins to see
I don't see anything under here Will
well you know what how about over there
you see that little tiny soccer ball
we can play with that one
see the lacrosse sticks you have there
see the little soccer ball
on the heater over in the corner
in the corner
not on this table William over by the wall
over
look at where my finger's pointing
see the yellow
see the yellow and the blue
lacrosse sticks
right between them
see that little soccer ball
yeah
I'll wear
I'll wear the other glove
okay
and you wear that one and we'll play catch
how about like that
does that
does that sound like a good idea
good
I'm gonna put my glove on
I'm just trying to get more area
here
here I'm
no no no no
here I'll sit
I'll go over here and you go right there
okay
oh good throw you ready

good throw William
you ready
yes here give it to me I'll throw it again
hm
do you want me to miss
alright
okay you want me to miss
okay
oh I missed
let me get the ball
you know what one of the tricks is to catching the ball
you're hands
these are still a little big for you
can you squeeze your hand together
you're thumb with your fingers
like do that
it would take a lot of strength
it would be very hard
you have to try do that
see that's the key you do this
you catch it and you put your hand over it
like this
ready
that was a good try
how about we just try to scoop it up
how about we just try to scoop it up
like you were doing because I think you were doing a great job
let's try that again
okay
you're gonna catch it like that
we have to keep our eye on the ball
right
can you get the ball
oh can you pick it up and throw it to mama
what smaller ball
oh I see it
I didn't see
yeah that's a
that's a small hard ball I like the soft ones in the house
yes
it doesn't necessarily have to look like a soccer but it has to feel soft like that one
well
most balls are for outside but I
you see how that that particular soccer ball is small and soft
that's the kind of ball I like to play with inside if we're going to play ball inside
okay
you know what else
you see where that
oh you don't want me to think
put it underneath my arm
okay
oh we're thinking
okay
Mr Potato
