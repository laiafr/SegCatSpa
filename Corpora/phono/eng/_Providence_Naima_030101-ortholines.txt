are you giving me a present
oh are you showing me something
yes
I see that
presents to plant
that s a nice kind of present
thank you
it s alright with me if you want to take the seeds out of that seed packet and put them in envelopes
that would be fine
while I m sorting these seeds
today is Sunday
April
eight
you can do that if you want and put them in here if you feel like it
or just put them in here
did we say what was the date today
do you remember
was it the seventeenth or the eighteenth
because you looked at it on the calendar and so did I
the different color
yeah bean seeds are not all the same color
okay signet marigold
it s okay you can pick them up
those are big seeds
they re easy to find
sow indoors
lightly cover seed
harden often
okay
we will plant some of these and those today too
fever fuel
the ones that you have
right there those brown ones
you can take them
you can do that
you well we can plant them when it s time to plant them
you know those zinnias that we planted last year never came up
here s the package of seeds from the zinnias
that was kind of disappointing
what was funny
that they never came up
I know
sow seeds outdoors in early spring
maybe we should
I think we might need to go to the garden store to get some flats to put our seedlings in
we have some containers but we don t
whoopsie
we don t quite have enough
this is parsley
direct sunlight
this is Nasturtiums
and basically empty
carrots
yeah I think you re right
I know
best grown as a crop
plant in mid June
I don t think so
I don t know why the carrots didn t come up
I ve always had trouble growing carrots
I don t know if it s because of the soil
it s not the right kind of soil or what
these need to be planted in June
or July
what does it look like
does it look the same
it doesn t look any different at all
oh dear
oh Calendula
right here
orange zinger
those never came up either
they
actually we got plants but they didn t bloom
that s what happened
direct seed after last frost
okay it goes in that category
and this is the chard
blooms during mid spring
to mid summer
the Calendula
well the
zinnias never came up
there are two kinds of chard this year
after all danger of frosts has past
yes Naima
does it look the same
what does it look like
hm
nah
can you put these things in the garbage for me
those that s garbage there
and this too
sorry there was more
okay here s all the different categories of seeds
these things we have to wait until we have our garden built
actually that has gotta go elsewhere
okay
there
and this has gotta go
direct seed after last frost
you have two kinds of bean seeds is that right
well that s what
that s all I m gonna give you right now because we re getting ready
let s see after last frost
to go investigate the problem with the grow core
or maybe to go to the garden store
plant outdoors today
because we need some flats to sow seeds in
okay
let s go look at that soil and see what the problem is
oh brother
oh not only is it looking
not different
I m gonna take this
out
I think
possibly
it s not fluffing up
yeah
I don t know let s sit here a while longer
I do not know why this is happening
but I think maybe we shouldn t have put the stuff on top of it to weight it down
let s leave it like this
I m gonna leave it here a while longer
now I think
I m gonna go to the garden store and get some flats
to grow things in
no no
I want you to leave it right there
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
are you hungry
you know you didn t have a second breakfast yet
you had milk second breakfast
do you
Naima
Naima
you re not gonna flip it over
no no no
you re all set
you re not gonna get a paper towel
what do you want a paper
can you tell me what you want it for
I know you did
I don t want you to touch the grow core
I want it to stay there and I want it to work
so we have to leave it alone so that it will work
hee hee hee
alright
let s go to the garden store
do you want some more breakfast
want some yogurt with berries
ah
sounds like a good idea
you can sit at your table here and have some and I ll sit with you
and do some kinda work while I m doing that
do you want porridge and yogurt and berries or just yogurt
you want porridge
just yogurt with berries
okay
oh
oh
this door
I shut the
oh Naima did that come out
lemme fix it please
I ll fix that
I shut this door by accident
and I shut it too far and now I can t get it to open
probably Daddy can fix it
I think Daddy s downstairs
I m gonna get you some
I just have to get Daddy to come upstairs and help fix the door first
or maybe even we left them at the vacation house
I think
that s possible
because I can t
I haven t seen them in our house for a while
so I
we should ask Babaji and Dadaji if we left them there
either that or they re in one of the cooler bags
or could be in Mommy s purse even
oh I didn t even get you your food yet
they might look in their silverware drawer
and find
the missing spoons
it s possible
that they might be able to find them
I m gonna bury the berries
I m gonna bury them in yogurt
there you go
there you go
know why it wasn t working anyway
there now it should be working
I m gonna play it back and see what happens
except I have to put it on something a little higher
I don t know what was happening before
I don t know why it wasn t working
yes
yes you are gonna be perfectly fine
you re not sick
more berries dear
canoe berries
I don t think we have any canoe berries
I don t think we have any canoe berries
I know you are
I know you are
look you re gonna finish this whole bag of blueberries
look
no
gone
gone
they re all gone
oh no
do you want more yogurt on top
just the blueberry part
oh brother
oh
yes
yes
what s happening
what s what
that s okay that it s not making any noise
I m not worried about it not making noise
yeah we don t want that to happen
have you been to the Autobahn Society where they have the big windows and you can see all their bird feeders
mm
are you talking about the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History
or the one in Wellfleet
I think Wellfleet
I don t think I ve taken Naima there
oh they have a great great window
overlooking the outdoors
we could make a tunnel with that
another tunnel
well if you d like to
Naima I think there s one right over there
oh well again you could put two halves together and make a whole one
so Mom whenever you wanna have breakfast
you can go ahead
okay
Naima you should have breakfast in a little while
there s fromage and there s muffins
ooh
yeah you can put some more halves together if we can find them
well this is kind of a
it s not really a half
it s a carved out piece you could put together
and that will make a whole
and here s a different kind of halves you could put together
Naima this is one that s cut on the diagonal
but that goes together and makes a whole one
and then
hm
I don t think that one
oh here
these two halves will make a whole one
a half blocks
that s a half block
two halves of a half block
mhm
where
we could make a tunnel with it
would you like to make a tunnel
well we could put it here
or you could put it over on the other side
yeah
yes
you need to use all the
it s good to use all the blocks up
it s fun
here s a half and there s a half
yes it also can make a square
and there s a quarter and here s a quarter
well that s not a quarter no
sorry that s a
a half block in a half
halved
a halved half block
look at the whole thing
does it need more work
or do you wanna go and have some breakfast
a lot more work
you still have more blocks
oh
oh no
oh the pig says oh no
why does the pig say oh no
oh really
he s seeing you
oh okay
he what does he see
oh okay
hey we got some more of these blocks
oh
well this is almost one of those but not quite
but if you put those two ramps together they would make a whole one of those
no not this one
the other one
that one
see if you can fit them together
to make one of those
other blocks
maybe if you put it on top you could
get it
you figured it out
very good
and do what
well we ve got some that are underneath here
well I don t think we have any that make a complete set
unless you wanna
unless you want to
okay
take those
yes you can
I m sure it s okay
okay

well I looked at it
about the garden

pear skin

bears love pear skin
Klar the Bar
Claire Bear
instead of Pear Bear you re Claire Bear
Mom would you like some pear
sure
I ll have whatever Naima has
do you wanna finish off her yucky porridge
no I don t wanna
actually I take that back
which she rejected
we don t get pears too often
no
these are
actually I got them when we were in Providence at the grocery store
oh
last month
organic
mhm
there s no pears on Cape Cod
sometimes it seems that way
the ones on Cape Cod aren t usually organic
oh
but you know what you need to do is to grow one
grow a pear tree
well
fruit growing on Cape Cod is
not good
not
it doesn t it doesn t work because of
because of fungi and
oh mhm
those some diseases
more so even than pests but
hm
I know people that have terrible trouble growing apples
and even people who
the one guy I know who used to grow apples organically switched over to
hm
using some kind of technology
chemical because it was just impossible
here
mhm
well
and even in Massachusetts I don t think there s any certified organic apples
you know has an apple tree
or maybe she does
hm
she doesn t
I think
I don t know if she actually sells them
Naima do you still wanna have your hair cut today
okay
do you wanna do it while Grandma still here
okay
Grandma do we have time to do that after breakfast
yeah
okay
what time is it getting
eight forty
yeah
maybe Grandma could read you a book while I cut your hair so that your head will stay still
what do you think
why
because you can t move your head when you re getting a haircut because the scissors could
hurt your neck a little bit
or they could cut your hair uneven
yeah
are you gonna put
the old fashioned way to cut hair was to put a bowl over your head
do you know that
that s funny
in fact I think my friend Mary Dunny
she cuts her son s
they don t have their hair cut all year long and then
the one son comes up from North Carolina
and she puts a bowl over his head
and she puts a bowl over his head and cuts his hair
that s pretty funny
and that s the only time he gets a haircut
and how old is he
he is
I think he s probably older than you
oh brother
let me think now
I think all her
are all her children older than you
no maybe not
I didn t think so
maybe not
but close
maybe close
yeah you re close in age
and she s older than you right
yeah she just turned eighty or
about eighty one
mm
yep that was excellent
Naima do you want a piece of cheese to eat
for some protein
we don t have any manchego cheese
we have cheddar cheese
there s kippers
do you want some kippers

I don t think I ve had mackerel
that s a good idea
yeah
something frozen with protein
something frozen with
I never heard of that
first frozen
oh warm it up
oh really
I think that s a good combination
that s a good
I haven t been able to find the mackerel yet
let me finish looking for the mackerel
Naima did have macaroni and cheese the other day
mhm
that was a good thing to have for breakfast since it did have protein
or maybe we used up the mackerel
let me just see
I don t know this is taking
you can start on the mackerel while I heat up the macaroni and cheese
actually I d better check
oh Naima guess what
there isn t any macaroni and cheese
we used it up
yeah I thought we had some but we do
when you ate it for breakfast the other day that was the last one
I could make some for you though on the stove

that s a very good question
I think a female blue jay
either looks exactly like a male blue jay or is a little
doesn t have quite as bright a color blue
cardinals come back
that s a really good question though
yeah
I don t know the difference
hm
I don t know the difference
I do know the difference with cardinals
the female is half brown
basically the female is
but you know what
the juvenile males look kinda like the females
oh really
you can t really tell them apart
because they don t get their
what does juvenile mean
young
are you a juvenile
child
are you a juvenile
is that another name
another word
that means the same thing as child
mhm are you wiping your face
playing hide and seek

can you say that
have you heard that word before
because it means wonderful great
fabulous
all those words mean the same thing
magnifique
exquisite
exquisite flavor
what do you say
do you say
what do you say Naima
it flew down there
yes
well the blue jay might spread the word that we ve got bird seed here
he might tell the other birds
and then the birds will come
different birds maybe
he will tell them ooh go over to that yard
that yard has a great bird seed
because birds like to eat bird seed
yes
but they can t get up there
they can t get up into the bird feeder
do you know why they can t get up
do you see the black thing on the bottom of the bird feeder
is that called a baffle
baffle
well I don t know
I mean I was wondering if that was actually a bear that knocked this one down
when I was here last year when you went on vacation
the first night you were gone on your vacation and Grandma was staying here alone there was a big big storm
a big storm
and I heard something knock this thing down
something was at the window
and it knocked it down
I didn t
it could have been a bear
it could have been but your Mommy says no bears on the Cape
that s right
so it must not
must have been a raccoon
zero on the Cape
what else could it be that would knock down that bird feeder
hm
and I know it wasn t the storm
I don t
how could a
I don t think a squirrel
a tiger
on Cape Cod
escaped from the zoo
I don t think so
well it must
probably a raccoon
because I can t think of any
oh tell Grandma about the raccoon that came
was it last week Naima
I think it was
well some time last week
what about it
tell tell her
tell me the story
oh
was he trying to get into your garbage
oh no can t do that
shouldn t do that
because raccoons and squirrels might come in
lemme get your fork Naima
a fork will help you eat it without getting your fingers messy and hurting your boo boo
it s not too hot
kinda cool actually
because the pasta was cold even though the sauce was hot
what do you think
the
do you want more sauce
I ll put some on then you stir it up with your fork okay
the sauce is pretty hot
that s cheese sauce
it s cheese sauce
cheese is what has the protein
it s got cheddar cheese in it
don t you need to pull the dish a little closer to yourself
there you go
I heard a bird but
what bird is that
there s a little milk to drink
Naima you only can have the water if you do not put your spoon or your hand or your fingers into it or any food into it
it s for drinking only okay
there s a sparrow on the ground
hm
what
oh you re right
oh there s the cardinal
there s the cardinal
mm it s on the fence post
over on the it was over on the fence post
it just flew away
but now maybe he ll come back
maybe he ll come
do you get cardinals on your porch
really not too much goes on on our porch
mhm
it s so dark and
I mean
you don t have a feeder though either right
no we don t have a feeder
boy did some bird flew by
I couldn t tell
it was too fast
how do they get to your feeder
well maybe they spread the word
to the other birds I ve
oh there
hey there s the cardy
I don t think you can see it now but maybe the cardinal will come over
they are
really
blue jays probably scare cardinals
oh there s a very big bird
cardinals just sitting over there
I don t you can t see it from your angle
it s in the tree over in the neighbor s
oh it just flew away
it s been around
I wonder if they have a nest around
well they come very frequently
the cardinals do
we always have a lot
hm
any more than one male at a time
hm
yes
what
you want tomato sauce
your kind
what kind is your kind
I will get you some
yeah
what kind do you like
what s the name of it
is it spaghetti sauce
or is it
just plain tomato sauce
is that the right kind
it s moldy
oh
I ll get some more out of the basement
oh we can t eat that
it s not good
because it ll make you sick
you a stomach ache
it s not fresh
yeah some fresh tomato sauce
this is the kind that you like
uhhuh
plain tomato sauce
plain tomato sauce
well
you want it on plain pasta
I m sorry you didn t like that
did you sleep through all night
Naima
no
you woke up at three o clock and you asked Mommy to nurse
that s so early
when I said it s still night time it s not morning yet you said no no it s morning
and I said it s not morning
do you mind if this is cold or do you want me to heat it up
do you want it heated up
you want it cold
both the pasta and sauce cold
hm
hm
usually I warm up the pasta and give you cold sauce but we could do the opposite
I bet you went right to sleep last night though
remember we went to the restaurant
for dinner
now that one
it s a new restaurant
that was a good restaurant
and very nice
nice to look at the walls and the windows
and listen to the piano
it was good food
no there s a chickadee
what does a chickadee say
what does a chickadee say
oh is that what he
I thought the chickadee said chickadee dee chickadee dee dee
maybe I can ask Grandma to grate some cheese for you
sure
grate it right into this bowl
have a plate instead is that
no
did you give me those bowls
I think yes you re right
I think you did
these were from a local
yeah
pottery shop
so if you come
in June would that be like a long weekend
that last weekend of June
yes that would probably make it a long
oh there s the cardinal
and Bill would come too right
yeah
okay
well I m gonna put it on the calendar so that we don t
have any
the chickadee
but there s
over on the wire is the cardinal and I think it s the Momma cardinal
there
do you see the cardinal now
over on the fence
over on the fence behind your daddy s car
right over there
can you
oh
well he flew off
he won t go to the
there s a robin
so far I haven t seen him go to the bird feeder
I don t know why
oh I know why I was confused because we actually don t come back until that Tuesday
we re gonna get here
oh
we have vacation
he
because has that Monday off
and then Tuesday is his regular day off
hm hm
so we have full
although we might be back actually earlier
this is probably enough for Naima
yep
would you like some cheese
do you want me to
you wanna say thanks to Grandma for grating
oh there s the cardinals at the feeder now
for grating it for you
can you see it
he flew off
doesn t stay very long
hm
is that a goldfinch
little bit too bright to be a robin I think
oh wait no you can t see it it s way up in the tree
maybe it ll come down
where let me see
yeah
they re starting to get the word that there s seed down here
where s the
it was up there in the tree but I can t see it now
it s very
oh look there s a cherry tree in bloom right there
I didn t notice that before
oh that s a cherry not a magnolia
mhm
yeah
magnolias have big big blossoms
magnolias up in Providence it s gorgeous
mm
because it
they re Heteras here
there goes the bluejay
yeah
and
and Providence has a lot of red bud trees which
mhm
we don t have
oh
I think they don t grow well here or something but
they re just
I mean they re kinda like cherry trees except the color is more intense and they re earlier
and they tend to be these huge trees so no leaves and just
a kind of brighter pink
yeah
little flowers
well that s the
I think I was away part of the weekend at the reunion down in Port Jarvis
area
that s what you re doing then
yeah
you know our reunion

we get black ants sometimes
we get spiders a lotta
hm
in fact there was a spider in the shower this morning
oh
a daddy long legs spider
in your shower
in my shower
oh I think that s because that doesn t get used very much
yeah
so they set up home there
I washed it wash down the drain
daddy long legs
why do we call it that
because they have very very long legs
and I don t know why it s called that
you know I don t think those are actually spiders
daddy long legs
oh yeah
because I don t think they have the same
there re not enough
ah
if you count the number of legs it s not eight legs
why was it in
well maybe it was attracted to the water
probably because I turned the shower on
and it was in the shower
well I think it went down the drain
because it was all wet
well it couldn t swim
I m not I saw any
where did I
take the train when I came with Naima and got picked up by you
you came to Brewster
Stamford

I took you to Stamford
yeah
and that was after I d been in New York
or before
let me think now
I think that I
you had been to me and then
I think I went from you to New York

you picked me up in Stamford

Laura
you came from New York up to Brewster
but I think took me to
the commuter rail
oh
from in New York I got on the train to Brewster
I m pretty sure
yeah
you came up to Brewster
and then you picked me up
