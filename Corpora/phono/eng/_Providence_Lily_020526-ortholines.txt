hello
hello Ariel
how are you
what's Ariel doing honey
she's swimming
really
wow nice
yes I can please
should we read your new book again
animals should definitely not wear clothing
animals should definitely not wear clothing because it would be disastrous for a
porcupine
look his quills are sticking right through his shirt
oh goodness
because a camel might wear it in the wrong place
what's he wearing on his humps
hats where should he be wearing the hats
that's right
because a snake would lose it
he's losing his pants
oh my he needs to put his pants on
because a mouse could get lost in a hat
oh my gosh
because a sheep might find it terribly hot
oh that sheep is sweating he's so hot
he's panting
I'm so hot
because it could be very messy for a pig
that's right and he's his carrots fell onto his tie
because it might make life hard for a hen
a hen is another word for a chicken
yeah
oh my gosh he laid her egg in her pants
it's stuck in her pants now
whoops
whoopsie
because a kangaroo would find it quite unnecessary
kangaroo already has a pocket I don't think the kangaroo needs another one
I think it's a baby kangaroo
that's right the mommy
because a giraffe might look sort of silly
oh my gosh that's silly
and just one
like Daddy
yeah
because a billy goat would eat it for lunch
oh my gosh that billy goat is eating his own pants
isn't that very silly
yes that is so silly
because
oh my gosh it fell down
because it would always be wet on a walrus
he went swimming and his clothes got all wet
because a moose could never manage
he got his antlers stuck in his suspenders
oh my gosh
because possums might wear it upside down by mistake
because possums like to hang upside down
but most of all because it might be very embarrassing
the elephant is wearing the same dress as the woman
haha that is so silly
hm hm hm hm
yay
that was a good book
oops
whoopsie
what does grandma Barbara say whoopsie poopsie
yeah
