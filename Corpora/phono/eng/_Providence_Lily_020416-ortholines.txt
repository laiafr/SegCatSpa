mhm
Lily loved school
she loved the pointy pencils she loved the squeaky chalk and she loved the way her boots went clickety clickety click down the long shiny halls
Lily loved the privacy of her very own desk
and she loved the fish sticks and chocolate milk every Friday in the lunch room
and most of all she loved her teacher Mister Slinger
Mister Slinger was sharp as a tack
he wore artistic shirts and glasses on a chain around his neck
and he wore a different colored tie for each day of the week
mhm and what color s this one
right
wow said Lily
that was about all she could say wow
instead of greetings students or good morning pupils Mister Slinger winked and said howdy
he thought that desks in rows were old fashioned and boring
do you rodents think you can handle a semicircle
and he always provided the most tasty snacks
things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy
I wanna be a teacher when I grow up said Lily
me too said her friends
what s on your book
really
maybe some crayon
oh
we ll have to try and clean that off
oh thank you
oh very nice thanks honey
at home Lily pretended to be Mister Slinger
I m the teacher she told her baby brother Julius listen up
Lily even wanted her encyclopedias
what s with Lily asked her mother
I thought she wanted to be a surgeon or an ambulance driver or a diva said her father
it must be because of her new teacher Mister Slinger said her mother
there she is she s dressed up like Mister Slinger
she s pretending to be Mister Slinger
here she is
that s her here
whenever the students had free time they were permitted to go to the light bulb lab in the back of the classroom
huh I don t know it must be other kids in her class
that s Julius
over there
these are other students in her class
when Mister Slinger had bus duty Lily stood in line even though she didn t ride the bus
she raised her hand more than anyone in the class even if she didn t know the answer
and she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers
you re right he is wearing a yellow tie
one Monday morning Lily came to school especially happy
she had gone shopping with her Grammy over the weekend and she had a new pair of movie movie star sunglasses complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mister Slinger s
she had three shiny quarters and best of all she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened
Lily wanted to show everyone
not now said Mister Slinger listen to our story
Lily had a hard time listening
she really wanted to show everyone
not now said Mister Slinger let s be considerate of our classmates
or a diva or a pilot or a hairdresser or a scuba diver
right
she s giving a haircut to Julius
oh let s see it looks like she maybe she s a pilot there she s flying
oh she s a doctor there
she s a ballerina there
she s a scuba diver
she s a diva singing
an ambulance driver
wow

octagon
right
a soccer ball s white and black and the little black shapes are pentagons

you tell Manuela about all the different flowers okay
yeah why don t you tell me
do you remember what those are called
she s giving the lesson about how she s naked under her dress
you know I know why I didn t see this light
uhhuh
because it s commercial
look there are lilacs
you know what is that bad
oh okay
because I saw that it said that and I and it said for new or renovated houses and I thought I don t know if the wiring s gonna work
I looked at it it looks fine but I didn t look at commercial I only looked at residential
right
that must be commercial too
yeah they didn t it was the only they didn t have anything similar in the residential stuff so I just
yeah
figured well we ll give it a whirl
yeah
I of course would take full responsibility if it turned out it had no place in this house
they re they re turning colors
well the thing about the commercial thing is that they use more they give you more of installing it
oh
hm
so in other words this light already comes with a in the residential they only
which ones
uhhuh oh oh I see
they hurt
how did they get this thing in here
oh god
I still just think it s so curious that you have to put those in and not put any decent lighting in that room
yeah
what r ya lookin at
oh you are
look who I brought
blankie
blankie
strawberries
the purple crayon book
yes
one evening after thinking it over for some time Harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight
there wasn t any moon and Harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight
and he needed something to walk on
he made a long straight path so he wouldn t get lost
and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him
but he didn t seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path so he left the path for a shortcut across a field
and the moon went with him
the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought to be
he didn t want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest
how many trees are in this forest
yeah just one tree
yeah just one
it turned out to be an apple tree
the apples would be very tasty when they got red Howard thought
oh
he put a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples
he is going to scare Harold
it was a terribly frightening dragon
it frightened Harold and he backed away
his hand holding the purple crayon shook
suddenly he realized what was happening but by then Harold was over his head in an ocean
he drew water
but he came up thinking fast and in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat
he quickly set sail
ooh boy that s annoying huh
op it s gone
I think it was a car alarm
whadda you think
it was a car
yeah I think so
he quickly set sail and the moon sailed with him
after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without too much trouble
he stepped ashore on the beach wondering where he was
the sandy beach reminded Harold of picnics and the thought of picnics made him hungry
so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch
there was nothing but
pie
but there were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best
when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left
he hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste
so he left a very hungry
moose and a deserving
porcupine to finish it up
and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was
he knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see
oh he s climbing up the mountain to see if he can find his bedroom
oh he is
let s see
he hoped he could see the bedroom from the top of the mountain
oh
he looked down over the other side and he fell off
there wasn t any other side to the mountain
he was falling into
thin air
but luckily he kept his wits and his purple crayon
and he made a hot air balloon and grabbed on
he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in
he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn t see his window
he couldn t even see his house
so he made a house with windows and landed the balloon on the grass in the front yard
none of the windows was his window though
he tried to think where his window ought to be
oh it must be in back of the house I bet it s back behind the house right
yeah
he made some more windows
he made a big building full of windows
he made lots of buildings full of windows
he made a whole city of windows
but none of the windows was his window
and he couldn t think where it might be
he decided to ask a policeman
the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway but Harold thanked him
and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in his bed
then
he remembered
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon
it was always right around the moon
yeah the window is right around the moon
then Harold made his bed and got in and drew up the covers
the purple crayon dropped on the floor and Harold
dropped off to sleep
very good sweetie
very good
yeah you did
yeah
where did you watch Harold
Harold was on tv
really
in our house
