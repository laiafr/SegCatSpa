it was yesterday

Naima
oh you want some water

I mean I saw them taking it off
yeah
they just probably didn t have a clear sense of what they were doing
I mean they aren t professional window cleaners they re professional
oh I know
had to be done I would ve done the same but I think that at some level they
well I haven t seen what the issue is so
I m feeding her right now

what I mean is they can t fix it right
