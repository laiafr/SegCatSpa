the moon makes a trip around the Earth about once a month it looks small to us because it is so far away
but it is almost as wide as the United States from New York to California
if you stood on the moon and looked at the Earth you would be able to see you would not be able to see any mountains buildings or trees you would see a blue white ball
the blue would be the Earth's oceans the white would be the clouds
do you remember looking at the moon in the telescope
with Daddy
did you know that the Earth is always changing

see
and then he's showing
to have
two claws
and he has
yep and this guy has a watch see this pointy claw

yep it's a branch right
now we'll just make the branch a little bit so we know what he's on
we'll make the branch come out the other end
like that huh
is that what he's on
well it's a little skinnier than that
right erase that part
that part's not quite right
it's a little skinnier
he's looking pretty good huh

that doesn't feel good
yeah
yeah it feels like a hug
so a little after the branch
Honey I'm trying to draw that
do you wanna get a paper and a pencil
you just wanna watch Mommy
I think I hafta make the tail longer
because this thing goes like that
and this part has to go a little bit longer
I can't draw it with you like that okay you need to sit next to me if you're gonna watch
no on top of me
and not over me
okay
yeah you can get your own pencil we got lotsa pencils you know where there are right in there

I'm just trying to get it to be just right
see like this part I already know it's gotta be it's gotta be longer that way
these guys gotta come down a little bit
and this thing I know it's gotta go like that and then out here
so then you just give yourself like a rough idea of what you're gonna do
whoa that would be difficult to draw don't you think
that's gonna be tough to draw
you think I could draw that one next
no
that one's got a lot of feathers
yeah
painted that already
