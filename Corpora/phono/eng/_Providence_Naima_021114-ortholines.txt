I think I have to open the door
just a minute Naima
the barn into the veterinary hospital
can we take some of the animals out to make special stalls for the sick animals
what do you think
let s take them out so that there s room for the
yes I know
I know
that s what he s doing right now
why don t you take the animals out and we ll have a veterinary hospital in the barn
and
okay
oh oh
you mean like a i v fluid is what you mean
oh great idea
yep animals might need special water
oh is that bees wax
I m making more room on the floor and taking down the trains
yeah
it might be hard to get that out actually
do you want that to come out
do you want me to help you
I think we need something to take it out like a chopstick or something very narrow that could poke it out
I might need a special tool to take out that wax
no something very narrow
like a pen even or
something very small
oh you took it out
oh no there s still a little bit in there
good it s not soft right now
there
now it s all out
should I take that
okay
great
so
the tree s gonna be the treadmill at the veterinary hospital
mm is that for checking how well the animals hearts are working
oh
okay
Pushpa is the doctor or the nurse
Pushpa is the veterinarian okay
okay
that s a good question
I think so
that tree is a painted tree
that I think is a willow tree isn t it
it s a certain kind of a tree that grows near the water
and what
yeah
it could be growing near the pond at the farm
mm to hold the base of the tree
well there s two pieces of wood making up that tree
there s this part and there s this part and this is attached to this with the screws
I think it s supposed to be the grass under the tree
I think that s what that s supposed to be
yeah
okay
okay here s the doctor
oh he s the veterinarian
okay
let s see
who s going to bring the sick animal
who s the sick animal now
which
all of them
okay
well in the morning the doctors probably have to do their rounds
that means they visit all the sick patients
oh so what happens at nighttime at the veterinary hospital
curl up
her mother is a doctor
I ll be right back
I m gonna look something up Naima
so only about five minutes has elapsed since I stopped recording
when I played it back I heard a little interference that then went away so I m hoping it s not major interference
okay
let s see what s happening with these animals
yeah
oh
okay that s the receipt
okay
yeah
okay we can play that when we get home from gym class sure
okay
do you want to keep playing veterinary hospital now
alright
alright oh is this a sick mouse
okay
where s the veterinarian
I think this this person is gonna bring the mouse into the veterinary hospital
this is my pet mouse and it has a hurt tail
can you examine my mouse and figure out what the problem is with the tail
and maybe bandage the tail
okay
there s not even
you mean which door is for which stall
oh it s hard when they re open to figure it out isn t it
these are the stalls that are veterinary hospital
is this the veterinary hospital
okay
okay does the mouse need some medicine
and who else is an animal who s gonna be brought to the veterinary hospital
this little cow hit its ear on a speaker at the concert
oh
well maybe this little calf needs its ear examined
and the mother is coming along with it to keep it company
and here s the doctor
what does the doctor say
mm
okay
well should I come back to check on my cows in the morning
okay
goodbye
goodbye
there s a stall for you I think where you can be while you re getting better here at the veterinary hospital
a colt
it hit its nose on Pushpa
oh
does it need a nose bandage
oh dear
that s quite
is that something like a concert injury
I see
oh and my horse and my colt are here at the veterinary hospital too
and I know they will take good care of them so I will go back to the farm and do farm work while they are here being treated by the veterinarians
treated well by the veterinarians
okay I ve got to go back and feed my other animals here
the veterinary hospital could have a barn cat who lives here who isn t sick who just lives here all the time
the pig s eating something
mm
what s wrong with the cat
it licked too much milk
oh
huh
did it get a tummy ache from that
I see
oh
okay
Pushpa what are you going to do
you gonna examine the cat
Pushpa is the veterinarian isn t she
yeah
you can t do it
what does she do
what s she gonna do to examine it
oh
shall we get some medicine made out of bees wax up here
here s some cat medicine
when cats get upset tummies they can have that kind of medicine
cause that s the
that s how it normally is
it s only soft if it gets warmed up by something like someone s body or
once I warmed it up in the oven and it all melted together and all the colors ran together
and came that time
are you gonna warm it up right there
it s gonna take it a while take it a long time to warm up
in the night
you mean when it falls out of my clothes
I think we re gonna need to get dressed to go to the gym class soon
cause otherwise we re gonna miss it
very soon though
let s play this for five more minutes and then we ll get on some
you could even wear your leotard if you want to
would you like that
what else happens at a veterinary hospital
do the animals that are patients there get fed every day
you think so
oh
but when they re sick they can t eat
are they gonna get some special water
do any of them need i v fluids
okay
hm
good
oh do we need a little container of milk on it
maybe we could get some white bees wax
do we have a tiny little bowl somewhere Naima
a tiny tiny bowl
yeah it s not really warm enough right now
ah this ll make some good milk
this is warm now if you wanna make some medicine out of that
I ll make some milk out of this one
I don t have any good place to put that
here I m gonna warm this white part up and make some milk out of it
can you find a little dish for the cat to eat from
mm well we need to use that
I guess you can use that for a little while
yes
here s the milk
no this is white milk
there you go
mm now the cat can have some milk
oops
the cat fell upside down in the big milk bowl
that s gonna be a wet cat
that cat s gonna need to be toweled off
toweled dry
don t ya think
let s check this
okay that seemed to be recording very nicely
let s see what s gonna happen next
oh really
I m gonna
while while that s happening I m gonna go and get the clean clothes of yours and bring them in here
oh and I can be doing that at the same time
ah doctor Lisa
doctor Lisa doctor Lisa
okay
let s find these clothes here
oh sick bears
oh my goodness
how did they get lanterns in their bellies
oh no
someone s bringing them to the
veterinary hospital
oh both brothers have lanterns in their bellies
oh okay
we re gonna help you feel better here at the hospital
first of all just lie down for a little bit
let me feel your belly
oh yes I feel the lantern in there
but those are very tiny lanterns aren t they
are you their mother
how big was the lantern
oh
I think they ll probably poop it out
who was there when they swallowed the lanterns their mothers or their father
a babysitter was there
oh
and then did the babysitter tell the bears father what had happened
oh
oh
oh and they couldn t take them out quickly huh
they just swallowed them by accident
sounds like they did it on purpose
are they little toddlers
oh bear
lemme give you a little medicine to make your tummy feel better
and let your mother hold you to help you feel better
really
oh
and that s why it s crying
hm
oh
I see
oh
that poor poor bear
I think the medicine will start working very soon and he will feel better very soon
oh that one needs medicine
okay let s get it some medicine
its mother is taking it away from the medicine
yeah but the mother has it and the mother can help it have the medicine
oh
well the doctor will come back in the room when the bear is ready to have medicine
the doctor has so many patients to see
the doctor can t wait
oh good
I see
mhm
alright let s go back in and we ll give the bear some medicine
okay okay hold the bear on your lap
the mother has to help the bear have the medicine
okay
okay little bear just calm down cause everything is gonna be alright
this medicine actually tastes like blueberries did you know that
it has blueberry flavor
here it is right here
see
it s not too bad
and then your mommy can give you hugs and kisses to also help you feel better
okay I m gonna give you a prescription to take home to get medicine for you bear
give that medicine to the bear twice a day
and he ll be better very soon
hey these don t belong with my underwear
this is your underwear
look at that
your underwear was mixed up with my underwear
now that goes in your drawer
come on
in fact Naima it s time to get dressed
yep because we re going to go to a new gym class
no it s not Cape Cod Gymnastics
no Sleepy it s a different gym
I sure am
I sure am
what song doesn t he like
how does he know what song is gonna be there at the gym class
are you talking about Cape Cod gymnastics
they do play loud music there
that s one of the things I don t like about that gym class
but this one I don t know if there s music or not
we ll just have to go and find out
but we do have to get ready
oh don t play with that it s not a toy
okay what I d like you to do is take off your big kid pants and
oh sorry about all this
and your pajamas
oh really
for me
I don t wrap very well
oh they won t all fit in that small piece of paper
today is Saturday February twenty eighth
hm
hm the calf and the cow
calf I said calf
mhm
mhm
okay
alright
well dogs eat dog food but we can find out more about dog food
okay alright
we ll find out about
oh
is he gonna put the milk in a little pail
I wonder if I could make a pail out of
oh you re right baby cows don t have udders
calves don t have udders
maybe I could make a milking pail out of bees wax
the animals are
oh there s a price tag on this
hm
no
let s see
well you know what we can make out of the yellow bees wax is
soft
against my body
we have to wait til soften up
some farm animals like to eat things like corn cobs from corn on the cob leftover cobs
I don t know if cows like that in particular but I think some other animals do
hello
hi guys
‹oh › I hope you re having fun
it s nice and bright in here
isn t it
it s very nice
I m coming to say bye
I was downstairs
and now I m going to the office for a little while
thank you
have ‹fun › Baby o
bye
what are you thinking a couple hours or an hour or what
‹well › you know I have
it s almost four
about five six seven hours of ‹work › so I m gonna do
okay
probably an ‹hour and a half › be home by ‹five thirty › six
okay
splishedy splashedy
here s a corn cob
one of the animals can eat the corn cob
you know we could look up which animals eat corn cobs
I know that pigs like them
I m not sure if horses are allowed to eat corn cobs or not
we could look that up
why you re right it s not very soft cause I didn t put this one in my bra
I m trying to make these without doing that
I was gonna make a milking pail with the black bees wax
is it
no
that one wasn t
here you can roll it just the way you roll Play Doh
did you know that
mhm
if you hold them in your hand even for a little while it will get actually
I ve actually started putting things in here in my in the waist of my pants
I think that s pretty hard
is it
maybe cause it s been in your hand for a little while
whose job is it to feed the animals at your farm
is it Veena s job or Pushpa s job to feed
it s his job
oh the baby doesn t belong there
why don t you put the baby in the cradle
put it there or in your bed maybe
an unmouthed baby
cause it doesn t have a mouth
I think that s just so that you can imagine the mouth that it has
sometimes it takes a while for these things to warm up
I was just handling that one
I just made that corn cob
I was gonna make the pail now
you were handling that
and it got warm
no I wasn t but that s a very thin piece so it probably wouldn t take much to warm it
put it against your belly and see if it warms up quickly
hold it with your palm and see if it gets softer
yeah I think so
yeah I was handling that
can you tell because it s softer
mhm
mhm
hm
mhm
I m making the milking pail so that the farmer can milk the cow
okay
oh from the cow nice fresh milk
here s the milking pail
pail
that s the pail
it s a pail to
well not if you re gonna squeeze it
otherwise you could have used it to put the milk in
yes I just made that pail that you are smashing with your fingers with great glee
are you smashing it with glee
hm
yeah this bees wax really does smell nice
I m gonna go down to the basement and photocopy something
if you wanna come with me that would be nice
Daddy s office
I have a little more milk for the cat
hm
a milk what
dish
oh
okay
well can I have the black back and then I ll make a dish out of it
it s not a pail anymore I might as well make a dish out of it
yes I was
that s the milk for the cat
a lucky cat
not all cats are given milk
not all cats like milk but those that do are lucky they have it
here s a milk dish
oh
Lubriderm for the cow
does the cow have a sore back or chapped chapped skin on his back
here is a milk dish
you can put the milk in here
yeah let s imagine that
the other cat can be looking from the barn looking way down at the other cat drinking the milk
what do you imagine that cat might be thinking
yeah
another dish
okay
I ll make a purple dish for the other cat
well I guess I m
I m actually molding it is what I m doing
except that s really too hard
I think I m gonna hafta see if I ve got anything else to make it out of here
there might be some
okay
I m making another dish for the other cat
mm
mm
mm
that s okay I ll fix it
here s a
you could just leave that there for now okay
well why don t you
yeah I don t want it to drag
it wouldn t be good for it to drag
I m attaching this to you
you look like a little
let s make a
let s make a pond at the farm
sometimes farmers will let the animals go down to the pond to drink water
who s thirsty
which animals would like to come and drink down at the pond
the calf
mm on a hot day
what about the horses
mhm
mm
hm
no I was actually going to make these into corn cobs so that the pigs could have something to eat
I think the pigs are hungry
you know what people say when they want the pigs to come and they can feed them
sometimes people say
you know when you call a cat you say here kitty kitty kitty here kitty kitty kitty
well when you re calling pigs you call them in a special way too
you say sooey sooey
that tells the pigs to come and get their lunch
or their breakfast or their snack
sooey
where are those pigs
sooey
Pushpa is saying sooey
he s got food for them
oh
sooey
sooey
hm
they re having some nice corn cobs
the cat s drinking their milk
that s a good question
I actually don t know
I don t know if there s one way to call roosters
hm
I don t know
I only know about pigs and cats I think
good question though
yes
yeah is it soft now
I don t think it was warmed up
and that warmed it up
mhm
there s the hens and the rooster
we have two roosters don t we
mm
there s no sticker
right
mm
well the ones that had price stickers were bought at the store store
and then some of them were bought the other animals were bought by Grandma as a present for you
yes
she bought you quite a few of these animals for Christmas
yep the pigs
remember when you first got the barn all we had was the Holstein and the calf Holstein calf and the barn cat one of the barn cats
and that rooster and that was all you had for a while
and then at Christmas Grandma gave you two hens one rooster two or three chicks
I think maybe there s a chick missing
and then she gave you the
what kind of cows did we decide these were
Guernsey
the Guernsey calf and the Guernsey cow and the other cat and the horse and the colt
and that rooster
yeah
and Veena and the well the water well and the tree
and then after that I got you
Mommy and Daddy got you the mouse and the fox
why
mm
this is a very nice farm
yes when I and Daddy got you the barn we got you Pushpa also
well I bought it but it s a present from Mommy and Daddy even though I was the one who actually got it at the store
it s a present from Mommy and Daddy
for you
it wasn t even Christmas it wasn t even your birthday it was just cause we thought you d have fun with it
you think so
are you sitting in the pond
oh
let s see
yeah
oh this is really soft now
do you want it
should I make a puddle
sooey
the pigs are in a big mud puddle
those pigs like to be in mud
what is Veena gonna help you do
oh
there s another mud puddle oh boy
even the little pig is in the mud
pigs like mud
oh you re the puddle
are you an animal
oh you re another pig
oh
ooh
it probably wouldn t really hurt him actually
well bees wax is just wax
it probably would
it might give him a tummy ache but there s nothing in it that s really really bad for you
hm look at this
I m making something like a window
mhm
duck food
are you whistling to that song Run Children Run with Daddy
is that on the American folk music album
yes
a little ducky
for the farm
mhm
this is its head that my fingers are on right now
okay it wants to swim in the pond
mhm
really
yes they could say
they say cluck cluck
would you like to go to the play ground
cause it s getting late
if we don t go now then we probably won t have time to go
alright
we don t have to
why would the duck be scared
oh the animals are making their noises and that makes the duck scared
the duck could just quack quack right back at them
ducks can be very loud and noisy too you know
the pig s scared of the duck
mm
because they re also birds
oh the cat too huh
hm
this hen s gonna eat the leftover corn cobs that the pigs didn t finish
yes
yeah she s supposed to be in a position to pick grain and eat it
mhm
is the farmer gonna help them find it
I don t know were you
oh that was the milk bucket
here s another puddle for them
mm
I wonder if the ducks eat flowers sometimes
I bet they do
this pig has got mud and dirt all over it
cause it s a pig
they like to wallow in the mud and the dirt
I think cause it probably makes them cool off a little bit
yeah I don t think they like hot
well most animals don t like to be too hot
even people don t like to be too hot
is it a muddy pig
is the farmer washing off the pig
okay
you re doing a good job making it say that
well that s what you just said though
I wanna eat the corn on the cob
don t smash it up
don t smash it up
what are you making out of the corn on the cob
what are you making
I would like to eat that corn on the cob
what are you making instead
wanna help that pig find it
oh are we gonna read books now
we need to clean up a little bit if we re gonna read that
oh there s a chick in here
where did you put
