okay once again trying
listen to the jingle
yeah the battery situation here
the battery situation is that I put new batteries in the transmitters
and there is actually also a new battery in the receiver
the receiver is what's attached to the camera
today is February third and we're just about one week late in recording
unfortunately because of the battery problem
oh you're right
it is listen to the jingle isn't it
I can hear that
rides along the woodland
you know the words to this
there's the yellow
very nice
okay let's see
what
listen to what again
this
this c d you mean
I like this c d
I don't get to listen to it as much as I like to
listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar is what he says
the rumble and the roar
I think that the Wabash Cannonball which is the name of the song is also the name of a train
and I'm gonna check this tape and make sure it's recording okay
okay that pause was only about two minutes long
Sleepy's train is called Sue and Maya
wow
it's called
dudameemurn
oh
yeah trains do usually have names it's true
did you know that
Letter Galoo
that's a good name for a train
oh
oh
Lubriderm
that's a funny name for a train
why is train called that
oh cafe car
oh the quiet car
elasicka
are you done painting
do you want me to take the paint away
do you want another piece of paper
or are you still painting Daddy's picture
yeah what
okay
okay
I'll get the orange for you
okay
yeah we'll wash that off later
orange is the only color you haven't used yet
so that the colors don't get all mixed up
if you wanna mix em up you can do that with the brush
but you don't want it to happen accidentally probably
whatever you wanna is fine on the paper
Ben Zanes is singing something like wake up
oh hop up my ladies
three in a row I think
three in a row
mhm
hop up my ladies three in a row
hop up my ladies three in a row no matter so the wind will blow
hop up my ladies
I think it's hop up
I don't know what this song is about
I think it's a very old folk song
but I don't actually know what it's supposed to mean
that's how it is with old song and old poems
sometimes you don't always know exactly what they're talking about
but you know what we could look it up
that's the kind of thing we can look up and find out
oh
what is he making rows of
rows of boys
oh
yeah
I don't know why cause I don't know about this song
I don't know all the why about this song
we'll have to look it up
it sounds like it's maybe a song about dancing cause it's about hopping
but that's just a guess
da da dee oh da da dee oh doh
let's see here
how am I gonna do this
I have to fry some onions

let's hide it so that it's a surprise for him
I will put it somewhere
so that it's really a surprise
so he can't see it until tomorrow which is his birthday
yeah
should we get it framed tomorrow for him
we can go to a store and buy a frame for it
I'll go with you and we can do that in the afternoon
Sleepy says that
he just says duh

but I was sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
my head is turning around I have to leave my friends in Kingston town
yeah it's probably called something like that
three cups of reserve poaching liquid
get the camera
sounds of laughter everywhere and the dancers
alright let's see if I can make this happen here
oops menu end
sad to say I'm on my way I won't be back for many a day
my heart is down my head is turning around I have to leave my friends in Kingston town
you're dancing with Sleepy
that's nice
sad to say I'm on my way
my heart is down my head is turning around I have to leave my friends in Kingston town
sad to say I'm on my way I won't be back for many a day
my heart is down my head is turning around I have to leave my friends in Kingston town
sad to say I'm on my way I won't be back for many a day
my heart is down my head is turning around I have to leave my friends in Kingston town
yeah

oh okay
just a sec
do you wanna sort silverware for me Naima
alright
where are we gonna put your picture to dry where it will be
where Daddy won't see it
but he might see it there
oh but he might go in there cause he uses that bathroom
oh how about the bathroom near my desk
he never he never goes in there
we'll put it there to dry
okay let's see
hey it's father goose
do you want me to put the light on in your room
did that tv explode
took what and threw it in the garbage
his television
alright this is probably a good time to see how the audio has been
he spilled water on the floor
she asked him to spill it on the floor
oh you mean to put out the fire
who is
who are we talking about here
the old Sleepy Bear
I see
oh

that's a potato
it looks like a pear but it's a potato
sorry
you want some apple
there isn't any fresh pear
well can you find it in your book rack
well I don't know where it is
you wanna just act out what happens with Sleepy
I think that George gets a lunch cart a cafeteria cart and rolls it around and rides in it when he's not supposed to
you could roll Sleepy around
and then it crashes into something
and all the food falls off of it
I think he does in that book
waltzing Matilda waltzing Matilda you'll come waltzing Matilda with me
he thinks it's a go cart
he sang as he sat and waited by his billabong you'll come waltzing Matilda with me
he doesn't
oh you think it really is a go cart

I think he pretends it's a go cart
hey it's the counting song
three and twenty six and twenty
seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty
two and thirty three and four and five and six and thirty
thirty seven thirty eight
oh okay
fifty seven fifty eight fifty nine sixty
that George book
well one sec
I've got something cooking on the stove
I can't walk out on it
alright I'm gonna come help you
I just have to
let me stir this
and I'll give a quick look for it in a second
alright
yeah hold on
yeah hold on
hold your horses
oh your microphone came off
can you stand still for a sec
was what on it
oh what a great time to have a phone
no leave it on
let me get the phone
hello
hi
hi
did you call me
I did a little while back
okay
I was on the phone
yeah I figured actually
after a while I realized
I had email from that she can't come this week
the first Wednesday of every month is another play group
they go to a Korean play group cause her son's adopted from Korea
so she's gonna do that this week so you still haven't met her
right
but if if you're doing craft it means there's only Naima and and I put in a call to but she wasn't home when I called her so I assume she's coming
what about
they are still
she's still on vacation
is she
yeah she was gonna miss two weeks
oh okay
yeah she's coming back this Saturday
oh okay
and I still have to figure out if I'm here next week or not but anyway so it's just three of us tomorrow
alright well I'm not sure what we're doing yet
I'm waiting for to get home to decide
so we might just be doing something simple
oh I don't care
yeah I mean
maybe just coloring or something
yeah you know I mean and I've got tons of stuff here too
so if you wanna just organize it with the stuff I've got that's also fine
well I have plenty of stuff and I'm glad to bring it
it's just a matter of you know just like how much time I have to get it ready tonight
you know there's really
since it's only three of us and it's gonna be short
we have to leave at eleven anyway so
yeah mm okay
you know if it doesn't happen I'll just get out paper and crayons and or you can get paper and crayons out
or markers
I just bought one of those huge rolls of brown paper at Home Depot today that is great
we could just spread it out and
oh that would be fun
we could even trace bodies or something like that
okay
so there's lots of very simple things
I wouldn't
yeah I know I'm not gonna go all out
I thought it would be fun to make valentines but I think about doing it next week but we might not even
oh
right
so let me bring that stuff cause I have it to make
oh that's great
paper
but I've been wanting to do it with her and I just haven't done it yet so that's a good idea
well
so maybe we'll do that if we're not gonna meet next week maybe still
well you know even if I'm not here you all can still meet
if I'm not
if I'm out of town you all can figure out if you wanna meet at house or
did you just go again
okay
yeah well we'll see
but we don't wanna miss making valentines so maybe I'll just bring that stuff
okay
good
alrightie
I'll see you tomorrow
alright
bye
bye
I'm gonna put this to dry over here
he never goes in this bathroom
well he does once in a while but I think he's kind of forgotten that it's here
so it's a good place to hide things from him
you think he might hide there
I have to go back to the stove because I actually have something on the stove
yeah I
let me stir
I'm going to
I have to stir what's on the stove first so it doesn't burn
I don't want burning onions do I
you know you can you can bury me up to my neck in the sand
go do
you're a shining star when you smile you're a shining star you can shine for me
yodel odel eh hee yodel odel eh hee
just in case you wonder just in case you care anytime you need a friend
I'll be there ooh you're a shining star late at night you're a shining star
in the dark all night yodel odel-eh hee yodel eh hee hee
fifteen minutes
yodel odel eh hee yodel eh-hee hee

the Curious George book and then I'm gonna go back
okay
oh
oh dear
oh is that what he's gonna act out
oh my
yes he swallows a piece of a puzzle
hold on let's see
there's lots of different places that might even be where the books are over there
you checked there
no but over here there are some regular books
I'm just gonna check
okay well let me just check
sometimes when another person looks it's just it shows up
what's a sock doing there
alright
was Daddy folding laundry today
you say that as if it would be a strange thing for him to do
hm why are socks here
okay
I do not see any George books here
you are right
I'm gonna look in the
I'm gonna look in the living room
let's look in the pile that's in the livingroom
here's George Goes to the Beach
mm
you're right
I don't see it either
mhm
what about in this pile of books that's here
that book is a library book and has
oh would you do me a favor
would you put this where we keep the the newspaper for recycling please
you know in the hallway
thank you sweetie
thank you for doing me the favor
alright now I still need to find that book
I'm gonna look in Mommy and Daddy's room too
it's dark in here
eek is right
eek
eek
alright let's see
there are some George books here
they're all kind of mixed in with the grown up books though
yeah okay
are you gonna sing happy birthday tomorrow to Daddy
oh a sleep present
I will be so happy if you give him a sleep present
I will be really really happy if you can do that
where is that George
George
where are you George
maybe he's in the back of the book rack
there's the hospital book right
can you pick up that item that does not belong in the hall
get your foot off please
let me look here
you can have whatever you want
these are your books
oh here's the library George book
but I just don't know where that other one is
it doesn't seem to be anywhere
I wonder if it's in the car or in Daddy's car
did we take it somewhere
yeah
what special book thing
oh you mean that sort of box that's in my car
mm that's where it would be probably if it is in my car
caps for sale we have a
alright if you're gonna take that take it okay
well put it back then
don't just leave it on the floor
okay
I'm gonna move this now
I don't know I'm really puzzled
I don't
let's check in here again
this is the George costume party book
we can also ask Daddy when he gets home if he has seen it anywhere
hm
well you can still act it out even if you don't have the book
but let's think about this
is there some other place where it could be
I wonder
could it be in the toy basket that's in the livingroom the one that looks like this
let me just check there
it's probably worth checking
oh you would like a puzzle
a puzzle piece
okay
here you go
there's a puzzle piece
oh
is he pretending to be George
did he swallow a puzzle piece
oh the man with the yellow hat had to go somewhere else while George was at the hospital
you know that would never ever happen in your house because we would never leave you at the hospital and go somewhere else
not until you're quite a big kid and even then we probably wouldn't
well it would depend on the situation
we would probably sleep in your room until you were quite a big kid
we probably wouldn't go anywhere
I mean quite big
huh what are you doing
whatcha doing little boo
the orange
what does that mean you're hiding from the orange
oh I see
well I'm going back to the kitchen now
what
I need to go cook
can you get down
what are you talking about
what orange
I see
well here
you can hold my hand
I have something else in my hand
what are you doing
what's going on with you
I'm gonna go put this bath mat in the bathroom and then we'll go back to the kitchen
and are you almost ready for some fish chowder
I think it will be very good
oh
you might be hungry huh
no no
Doctor Onion
why not
it's where we're gonna eat some supper
would you like to wash off the water color paint for me
if I give you a wet rag
why don't you sit up there
and do the table first and then and then you can do the
the chair
cause the chair needs washing off too
you see some
a red spot
mm okay
here is a nice rag which I'll put a little soap on
and you may wash off
wash off that blue if you can reach it see
good
mhm
hm you're doing the washa washa
to wash off the chair
oh you did do a good job with the table
wow
I'm very impressed
yes
well I think you need to get down to do the chair because I see some on the side that maybe you didn't see
so if you stand on the floor and wash off the chair it will probably be a little easier for you
mhm
