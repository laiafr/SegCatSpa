*MOT:	cause it's not good to swim where there's +... 2183533_2203745
*MOT:	you know , that's not like the oil we cook with .
*MOT:	that's oil that is used to put into cars and gasoline .
*MOT:	crude oil , it turns into that kind of oil .
*MOT:	come sit here next to me . 2203746_2205083
*MOT:	get comfy . 2210333_2212231
*MOT:	have a seat . 2215411_2217340
*MOT:	well , it lives there .
*MOT:	but let's [: let us] find out what it , where it lives and what it's doing and what happens to it . 2221213_2227510
*MOT:	this is called Oil Spill . 2227510_2231038
*MOT:	I'm not even sure what kind of animal that is . 2232745_2237691
*MOT:	yeah I guess I think it's an otter .
*MOT:	mm oil spills happen when big , big , big boats like this that are carrying crude , it's called crude , oil from one country to another have an accident of some kind and they spill their oil into the ocean . 2237693_2255681
*MOT:	that doesn't happen very often , but when it happens , it's not a good thing . 2255683_2260590
*MOT:	okay , and this is actually the story of an oil spill that really happened a while ago . 2260590_2270506
*MOT:	the night of March twenty fourth , nineteen eighty nine , was dark and cold . 2270508_2277996
*MOT:	this is how big that boat is .
*MOT:	a huge black oil tanker glided out of the port of Valdez , Alaska . 2277996_2285295
*MOT:	painted on its bow was its name , Exxon_Valdez . 2285295_2290031
*MOT:	the bow of the boat is this part , kind_of like the front . 2290031_2294518
*MOT:	the Exxon_Valdez floated low in the water . 2294518_2304518
*MOT:	about fifty million gallons of crude oil weighed it down .
*MOT:	the huge tanker slowly sailed out into Prince William Sound . 2304518_2310585
*MOT:	and then , suddenly , it happened . 2310585_2317485
*MOT:	crunch .
*MOT:	the ship slammed into an underwater reef .
*MOT:	thick , black oil flowed out of the Exxon Valdez's smashed tanks . 2317485_2323271
*MOT:	it poured into the dark water . 2323271_2326005
*MOT:	the Exxon_Valdez spilled out , out eleven million gallons of oil . 2326005_2337933
*MOT:	that much oil could fill over a thousand big swimming pools .
*MOT:	this is a picture of Alaska , Naima . 2337933_2341650
*MOT:	this is a map of Alaska right here . 2341650_2345976
*MOT:	this is where that oil spill happened , this part of Alaska . 2345976_2350161
*MOT:	are you cold ? 2350161_2351345
*MOT:	you're uncomfortable ? 2352853_2354166
*MOT:	the sticky oil soon covered eleven thousand square miles of ocean water . 2358110_2363583
*MOT:	okay , let's skip ahead and see +//. 2363583_2370778
*MOT:	oil stuck to the feathers of many ducks , geese , and sea birds .
*MOT:	the birds couldn't swim or fly . 2370778_2374021
*MOT:	some of them died . 2374021_2378028
*MOT:	oil got into the bodies of fish , shrimp , and crabs . 2378028_2384095
*MOT:	no one knows how many of them were killed . 2384095_2390751
*MOT:	mm , the oil is hurting the animals .
*MOT:	sea otters , sea+lions , harbor seals , and killer whales swallowed oil . 2390751_2398830
*MOT:	that's a whale .
*MOT:	they breathed the poisonous fumes . 2398830_2403031
*MOT:	these animals got very sick also . 2403031_2406311
*MOT:	hey , that's a (.) sea+lion I think . 2406311_2412560
*MOT:	do you remember we saw sea lions ? 2412560_2414458
*MOT:	yeah .
*MOT:	because it spilled out of the boat . 2420678_2422630
*MOT:	oil spills have many causes . 2422630_2426835
*MOT:	some are accidents . 2426835_2428588
*MOT:	like a tanker like the Exxon_Valdez runs aground , or collides with another ship . 2428588_2435270
*MOT:	that means bumps into another ship .
*MOT:	workers can make mistakes . 2440813_2443523
*MOT:	or an undersea oil well starts to lea(k) , leak . 2443523_2449243
*MOT:	or a pipe can break . 2449243_2451875
*MOT:	the oil spreads out . 2451875_2457498
*MOT:	it floats on top of the water . 2457498_2460533
*MOT:	experts on oil spills rush to the scene . 2460533_2468971
*MOT:	they start to clean up the mess .
*MOT:	the first job is to stop the oil from spreading . 2468971_2473195
*MOT:	they put a boom around the spill . 2473195_2478091
*MOT:	the boom is like a collar .
*MOT:	it keeps the oil in one place . 2478091_2481558
*MOT:	you see this red thing here ?
*MOT:	this is the boom . 2482263_2484145
*MOT:	it's usually made out of different things . 2484146_2488858
*MOT:	for small spills , the experts may call for a skimmer . 2488858_2493321
*MOT:	there are several kinds of skimmers . 2493321_2500586
*MOT:	one type works like a giant vacuum+cleaner .
*MOT:	it sucks up the oil from the water . 2500586_2504491
*MOT:	sometimes the oil the skimmer collects can be used again . 2504491_2509195
*MOT:	for some small spills , experts place special pads on top of the oil . 2509195_2516106
*MOT:	the pads are like sponges . 2516106_2518336
*MOT:	they soak up the oil , then they have_to get rid of the soaked up oil . 2518336_2523403
*MOT:	for larger spills , the experts may set the oil on fire . 2523403_2529153
*MOT:	clean up crews also use chemicals to get rid of large oil spills . 2529153_2537291
*MOT:	other chemicals make the oil come together . 2537291_2542603
*MOT:	the oil forms a layer like a sheet of rubber . 2542603_2546606
*MOT:	one type of skimmer , I guess this is the skimmer machine , lifts the sheet of oil and oily debris , that means garbage , out of the water . 2546606_2557980
*MOT:	oh , what kind of animals are these ? 2557981_2562068
*MOT:	puffins ! 2565318_2566130
*MOT:	sometimes , the experts decide that no action is the best way to treat an oil spill . 2567866_2574970
*MOT:	the wind and waves mix the oil and water together . 2574970_2579066
*MOT:	it is like mixing oil and vinegar to make salad dressing ! 2579066_2583301
*MOT:	in time , much of the oil disappears . 2583301_2587200
*MOT:	oil spills are major disasters . 2587200_2591873
*MOT:	it's a very bad thing that happens , that's what a disaster is .
*MOT:	slowly , scientists are learning how to clean them up . 2596773_2601580
*MOT:	they are learning how to prevent spills . 2601580_2604763
*MOT:	how can we help to prevent oil spills ? 2604763_2607818
*MOT:	that's a good question . 2607818_2612598
*MOT:	well , we can use less oil .
*MOT:	if we use less oil , there will be fewer oil tankers in the oceans . 2612598_2618778
*MOT:	then the chance of oil spills will not be as great . 2618778_2622941
*MOT:	one way +//. 2622941_2627068
*MOT:	I bet you didn't know this , Naima .
*MOT:	you might be surprised .
*MOT:	one way to save oil is to use less (.) electricity ! 2627068_2633565
*MOT:	did you know that oil and electricity are related ? 2634466_2637835
*MOT:	electricity is often produced by burning oil . 2637835_2642133
*MOT:	less electricity means less oil and less risk of an oil spill . 2642133_2647140
*MOT:	because sometimes power plants burn oil to make electricity that comes through the electric lines into our house . 2647140_2656550
*MOT:	another way to cut oil needs is to use less gasoline , which is made from oil . 2660083_2665765
*MOT:	gasoline is made from oil . 2665765_2668375
*MOT:	that means driving smaller cars and staying within the speed limit . 2668375_2674171
*MOT:	hm: . 2674171_2675106
*MOT:	oh , there's a child who wrote a letter to someone in the government . 2675106_2682331
*MOT:	and drew pictures of sea animals . 2682331_2686778
