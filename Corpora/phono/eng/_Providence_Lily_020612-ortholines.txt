one morning Ariel the little mermaid went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend Flounder
Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father King Triton and all the other merpeople
I don t think Flounder is a puffer fish I think he s a different type of fish
because the puffer fish
is very small and then when the puffer fish gets scared or angry it puffs up
right do you remember what the puffer fish name was in Nemo
his name was Bloat
Bloat
Bloat
Bloat
hm hm
but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father s concert
while they searched Flounder began to get nervous
what was that he asked did you hear something
suddenly a very large shark smashed through the side of the ship
swim a shark Flounder cried
they swam away very quickly Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where a shark couldn t reach them
you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
as shoe as soon as she was sure oh
Bloat
is that Bloat
Bloat the puffer fish
I think his name is Bloat
right
your friend Bloat
he s very cute
we got him at that little toy store on Hope Street
it s called Uncle Sig s
right
I don t know maybe the person who owns the store had an uncle Sig
or maybe it was just a funny name
Bloat
Lily for Liana s birthday present do you think
Bloat
hm bloat bloat
do you think for Liana s birthday we should get her a set of the vegetables Honey like this
you think that would be good maybe we ll get a set for Liana for her birthday present
bloat bloat
as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
even though he was a very small fish Flounder had a very big heart and he was Ariel s best friend under the sea
is she holding him
really
she s toding him
what does that mean
she s giving him some food
oh
after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home
Flounder likes to go to the supermarket and eat raspberries
