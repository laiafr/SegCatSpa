Franklin goes to school
would you like to come sit next to me
oh alright I thought you might wanna sit a little closer maybe
oh alright
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
he could zip zippers and button buttons
but Franklin was worried about starting school
and that was a problem because Franklin was going to school for the very first time
mhm
that's a calamari
oh okay
that is good cake
huh
oh alright
yummy
it sure sounds delicious to me
okay I'll be listening for that
okay
Franklin woke up with the sun
it's my first day of school he told Goldie the fish
Franklin packed his new pencil case with a ruler a pencil an eraser and twelve colored pencils that he had sharpened himself
then he woke his parents
look that's Franklin's pink eraser
he has an eraser like yours but yours has a little bee on it
right
right
mhm
right
hurry he said to his parents I can't be late for school
Franklin's mother looked at the clock
even the teacher's not awake she laughed it's too early
you must be very excited said Franklin's father
Franklin nodded
it was so early that there was time to make a big breakfast
you'll need a full tummy to work at school said Franklin's father
Franklin wasn't hungry
I already have a full tummy he said it feels like it's full of jumping frogs
Franklin's mother gave him a hug
I felt that way on my first day of too my first day of school too but the funny feeling went away
Franklin ate a little bit and double checked his book bag
finally it was time to go to school
halfway to the bus stop Franklin clutched his tummy
I don't wanna go he said
Franklin's father gave him a hug
that's how I felt when I started school he said but look all your friends are waiting for the bus too
that's a good question
is that Beaver's mommy
no it's not
ah I dunno it looks a little more like an otter to me than a beaver doesn't it
yeah let's see
there were there was a big crowd at the bus stop
there were brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers
Beaver was carrying her favorite book
I can read it she said
ah it's Franklin's friend Snail
all of it asked Bear
yes Beaver answered proudly
Franklin rubbed his tummy
Rabbit pulled out a brand new notebook
my big sister showed me how to write my numbers he said
all of them asked Fox
most of them boasted Rabbit
Franklin looked at his mother
I wanna go home he said
we'll be here after school to hear all about the things you did today she said
when the bus arrived Rabbit grabbed his sister's hand and climbed aboard
Bear stood on the steps and waved goodbye again and again
Franklin hugged his mother and then his father
he kept hugging even after his friends had found seats
as the bus pulled away Franklin looked out the window
he didn't know if he was ready for school
do you think the teacher will yell wondered Rabbit who jumped at loud noises
do you think there's a bathroom asked Beaver fidgeting in her seat
I hope someone has an extra snack said Bear who had already eaten his
Franklin didn't say anything
the bus ride seemed very very long
oh gosh I wonder
I wonder who that could be
maybe
oh could be the otter you're right
right
yeah
or it could be the raccoon too right
there's the raccoon
yeah
I dunno maybe he was sitting in a different seat
oh yes
when they arrived their teacher was waiting
Mr owl said hello in a gentle voice
he showed them where to hang their coats and where to sit
he showed them
it looks like they're playing with Playdoh
yeah
he showed them where to find the bathroom and offered everyone a piece of fruit
then Beaver and Bear went to the reading and writing center
Rabbit went to the play kitchen
but Franklin stayed in his seat
well we'll have to ask him
what would you like to do today Franklin asked Mr owl
I don't know said Franklin rubbing his tummy
well he's a lil nervous on his first day of school
I can't write all the numbers like Rabbit can and I can't read like Beaver can
Rabbit and Beaver will learn new things at school and so will you
Franklin started to doodle
I can see you're a very good artist said Mr Mr owl
Franklin stood up
Franklin sat up taller
I know all my colors too he said
what color is this asked Mr owl holding up a colored pencil
it's a special blue said Franklin
it's turquoise
now you've taught me something said Mr owl
is there something special you would like to learn
there were so many things that Franklin wanted to learn that he had trouble deciding
finally he asked Mr Owl to help him read his favorite book
he made a building of blocks
he sorted the money in the classroom store and he painted four pictures
one for the teacher one for himself and two for his parents
it was a wonderful day
Franklin sat at the back of the bus all the way home
he bumped up and down ooh don't hurt your boo boo Sweetie
do you want another bandaid
he was so busy
what do you want
okay can I finish the book and then I'll go get blankie
he was so busy having fun he almost forgot to get off at his stop
his parents were waiting
how's your tummy they asked
Franklin looked puzzled it had been such a good day he'd forgot all about his jumpy tummy
my tummy's empty he said
well that's a feeling that will go away too said his father
I made this for you said Franklin's mother and gave him his favorite snack fly pie
and I made this for you said Franklin and gave his parents two pictures and two big hugs
shall I get you a bandaid and blankie
you'll touch blankie after you finish
