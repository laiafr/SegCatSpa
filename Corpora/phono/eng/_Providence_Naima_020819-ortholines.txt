uhoh the puppy s loose
what s the puppy inside of Naima
usually that s called a crate
an animal goes around in a crate
or some people might call it a dog carrier
I would call it a crate
opened the door
he s not supposed to do that he s suppose to stay in there
until someone comes to take him out
he s not supposed to get out of his crate by himself
he s supposed to come out only if someone comes to let him out
well he probably just came
I think that puppy just arrived
and a crate is something that
people use to take animals from one place to another
oh read it
watch out for the plant
it is falling down in this picture when you move the tab it starts to fall down
because the puppy is using his teeth to
yank it
let go of Kitty s pillow
you know you could say Mommy read this please instead of just saying do this
better not pull that
the puppy looks startled
I think the puppy didn t know there were so many things in the closet that were going to come falling out when he opened the door
that s a messy closet
actually it doesn t have any words to read
what s that puppy doing now
that s a show about an elephant isn t it
