the embassy of nature was founded by individuals feeling an urgent need to participate actively in the defense of the rivers forests lakes and jungles that we love
the organization is compromised
comprised
of a circle of friends from around the planet
it is our belief that the present greed and ignorance
motivated destruction of earth's ecological life support system is placing all humans in peril of extinction
we must act now
