I bet they like that one
oh we got a little keep this there
alright
the librarian knows how to read those books
mhm
oh there's Mr and Mrs Mallard they're looking for a place to live
I think maybe they're gonna have some chicks
so they need to have a nice nest to live in
so they're trying to figure out where's a good place to build our nest
well you wouldn't wanna build a nest in a bad place
you wouldn't wanna build a nest in someone's bath room
you wouldn't wanna build a nest right on a street would you
because it wouldn't be safe
let see what happens to them
when they go to Boston oh boy
hm
well what else would be a bad place to build a nest
let's ask let see if bird children know the answer to that question
well I wouldn't wanna build a nest right near some foxes
and I wouldn't wanna live in a nest where there wasn't any food near by
and I wouldn't wanna build a nest next to a play ground where there're lots of noisy children all the time
I wouldn't build a nest in a refrigerator
it will be to cold
just speaking bird language
because that's what birds really speak
ha ha ha ha
I wouldn't wanna build to build a nest near a camera
why Naima
why
oh I wouldn't wanna build a nest right next to a bear
that would be scary
I wouldn't wanna build a nest on an airplane
I definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a cat
I definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a dog yikes yikes yikes
that's right dogs barking is loud and the birds might get annoyed by the dogs barking
that would be an a noisy annoying noise for the birds wouldn't it
near a duck
why not
duck is just another bird
may be it'll be okay to build a nest near a duck
should we read the rest of the story
hey that's the same did you hear the noise out there
is the same noise that Carmen makes that must of been a cardinal
I think Carmen is do you hear that
I think they're talking to each other cardinal must be Carmen must be talking to the other cardinal that are outside
what a nice bird
hm okay
oh they're going fishing here they're looking for fish to eat in this pond
and here they see the swan boats
see the swan
these are called the swan boats
and here are the children riding bicycles the birds better watch out
those ducks better watch out so the bicycles don't run them over
oh my goodness they almost ran them right over
hm so they flew over beacon hill around the state house but there was no place there
they looked in Lewisburg Square but there was no water to swim in
they flew over the Charles River
oh that's where they gonna oh they found an island and that's where they going to build a hah look at that there's their nest
who's that
oops
those are teenager birds
well it just needs to be close to your mouth that's all
because it's it's recording your voice
is that what you want them to here
okay
is that like what a baby says
but they wanna know about what a toddler say
is that what a baby or toddler says
toddler
is the name of that police officer
that's his name
hah look at that what do they have in the nest
one two three four five six seven eight there're eight eggs in the nest
hah and pretty soon they hatch and they have eight chicks
ducklings really those are ducklings
what do you think the mama duck says to the ducklings
their children
because the bicycle the person on the bicycle didn't realize that there were ducks in the way
here're the ducks they're growing up and getting bigger now they're kinda like toddler ducks
oh the mommy still takes care of them
she's teaching them how to swim and dive
that's how they get around they swim and that's how they look for food in the water
here they're they're lining up
she's teaching them to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels
that's kind of like when I tell you have be careful in the parking lot
and that cars are dangerous she's she's teaching them the same thing she's saying cars and bicycles and other things on wheels are dangerous cause they can bump into you
that's just what Mommy taught you Naima
do you remember I taught you that
do you remember
why
is it almost nap time
let see what time it is
oh it certainly is nap time
it's past two o'clock
do you know what we we have that we can use at nap time now
the tape player
yeah and do you know what I brought in from the car for you to listen to in the tape player
I brought the jamboree tape in
would you like to get into bed and start nap time

I'm now testing whether the buzz is coming from or rather which
the bears are all cozy on the examination table I see that
it's still august twelfth I replaced a battery and hopefully the buzz will not reoccur
he's at a doctor hospital
oh did he did an ambulance taking him there
oh you were the driver of the ambulance
oh so you helped him get into the ambulance you know ambulances actually have bed inside them did you know that
oh in the ambulance you mean
yep
what book is that
what
what's that
that's a mattress it use to be in your baby bunk
when you were a baby
that's a mattress we used for the baby bunk
that's the right size for the baby bunk
because a baby bunk is like a little bed for babies
that's what you use to sleep in
because the baby bunk was attached to Mommy and Daddy's bed
and you were too little to be in the bed so we had to attach your bed to our bed it was a little tiny bed
and you know who's borrowing it right now
Molly and Mellisa
cause she's going to have her baby
cause the baby's been inside long enough
now the baby's ready to come out and say hi to its mommy and nurse
probably
why
why do why does why do babies do that
yes we do
yeah
when when baby comes we mail that present to the baby or we'll bring it to him
so he can play with it
it's a baby toy
well baby toys are just like a little things they can pull on or push on or look at
little babies don't really have very interesting toys for toddlers
I put on your oh I put on your big kid pants backwards
