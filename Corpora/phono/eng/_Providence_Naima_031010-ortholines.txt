okay
oh I m gonna be the
yeah you can
I can t play if you don t clip it
please clip it let s play
how about if I clip it to the bear
you have to
that means you have to keep them still though
okay keep him
well while you re in the while you re in the wagon just keep him right where he is okay
okay
he s all snuggly
but what s important is
in fact I m gonna see if we
I think you could clip it to Naima s shirt that would be fine
it s okay like this
it s okay like this
but the important thing is not to touch that too much
or not to touch it at all actually
because that would mean we d just hear fuzz when we play it back and we don t wanna hear fuzz we want to hear what you were saying right
this is the microphone if you touch it it s gonna give a fuzz sound which won t be good
no
so who s the customer am I gonna be a customer
oh yeah
yeah
Naima has a slight cold
Naima s voice
I noticed that
Naima s voice is not quite what it usually is
what does this go to
oh right okay
Naima is in her wagon
okay I m the store owner
where is it
it s over there
there s a book mess on the floor
I don t think you can use the wagon when there s a book mess can you
mm
really
which way
which way
I didn t see which way you were pointing
this way
that way
that away that away
this way that away
oh clunk
I don t think we re gonna have a blizzard like that in a long time Naima
that was probably one of the worst blizzards that Cape Cod has had in the last fifty years
it s a lotta years yep
twelve is a lotta years too
yeah
yep
there was a very bad blizzard almost this bad seventeen years ago
that s a long time ago too isn t it
I guess Daddy will wear his microphone
although it s actually Naima s
a voice we really wanna have on our recording
I wish Naima would wear the microphone on her shirt so we would have a very good recording
if she stays where she is right now it ll be fine
if you wore the microphone on your shirt we would have a very good recording
oh I know that s what Mommy says
but I think if you really wanted a really good recording you would wear it on your shirt
if you wanted it
that way we
I m gotta open up my store
hope I get a lotta money and a lotta buyers today
okay
okay
okay
okay and what are we doing now
are we going to the grocery store
okay
I m I m videotaping people at my store
oh some stores do that did you realize that
some stores do that to protect themselves from robbers
well sometimes robbers go into stores when they wanna steal things and not pay money
well because if it s recorded on the video then we have a picture of who the robber was and then the police can go find them later
so that tells them they really shouldn t do that because they ll get caught very easily
well because if they know that there s pictures being taken of them then then they ll know that police can find them
yeah that s the idea
so shall we go to the store
okay
so you re not gonna be Miss Chaos in this one are you
oh you re Miss Chaos the sister okay
that makes me Mr Chaos
