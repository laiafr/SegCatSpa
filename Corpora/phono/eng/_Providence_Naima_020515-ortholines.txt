oh his mother says the pond might be cold
I see
a water bear
want some help doing that
there
it's a cherry picker
look at that panda
well you know to be more stable you should go on the kitchen floor
well I would move it to
if I were making it stable I would move it to the kitchen floor 'cause that's more flat
put it
come put it on the kitchen floor and that will make it stable
it's okay just keep going
keep going
you're fine
I know
well it's okay
we'll fix it
like what
you did need a napkin
so I will get you a napkin
and you can wipe your own hand
on the napkin
does that sound like a good idea
well your hand's messy and you're making the table
messy
what are you doing
are you having
are you enjoying that pasta
is it actually good pasta
good
okay it's still the twenty ninth
of August
the previous taping was from this morning so there's been a bit of a gap here
would you like some juice instead of water to drink
okay
would you like
let me see what kind we have
we have grape juice and we have cranberry juice
alrightie
alrightie
and would you like to have some salmon or some crab
there's crab right there
it's right there on your plate
you would
are you gonna be a little king fisher
oh that's right
bears do eat salmon
in fact bears love salmon
they do
where's the salmon
oh hey hey
are you a bear zub
here's some salmon little bear
oh you're a king fisher
you changed your mind
is that what you are telling me
oh
some salmon
oh you're a baby king fisher
salmon
that's the top of the salmon
that's the color of the top of the salmon
you can eat that too
okay so my stuff is there
picked out
and
that includes what I'm gonna wear tomorrow
so
so everything else in the other bag
everything else is in the other bag
I zipped up my little section but there's plenty of room although all those are clean
do you want anything
washed
tonight
'cause I I kinda want my jeans
that's why I was gonna
I don't need anything washed but if
wash my jeans and my fleece
did I leave stuff out on the grass there
I might have
the little bear doesn't like her salmon
oh the king fisher doesn't like her salmon
how 'bout if
yeah how 'bout if she just drinks a little there
birds drink water
that baby bird is drinking juice instead
king fisher has wings for flying
mm
what a sweet little king fisher baby
hm after
you changed your mind
what baby are you again
what kind of baby are you Miss Boobahloo
oops
that's not to be knocked over Naima
you wanna take that off
okay Daddy will help
yes that's a very nice bracelet
it's a hair elastic bracelet
well it's a bracelet nevertheless
you turned it into a bracelet
'cause you wanted to
is Mommy wearing a mic
yes I'm wearing a mic
oh
yes I am
I'm sure all that noise is really
what
I said I'm sure all that noise is really good
well
that's just how it goes I'm afraid
so Miss Boo what else are you eating
oh Mommy's cleaning up
she's packing up some stuff
oh
is that a
no it's your feet
it's number
number one and two onto the window
oh
one two one two one two
is that number one two one two one two
hey there's a fly in this place
oh what're you doing
are you gonna
wave it away
gonna scare it off
y'know that's a bit of a challenge actually
it's a challenge to shoo that fly straight out the door
'cause flies don't
they don't like to be herded very well
they're not like sheep
sheep you can shoo into a particular spot
but flies fly wherever they want
is there a fly on your sippy cup
no
oh you're shooing the fly away
good
oh I don't think these flies bite
I got a fly bite today though when we were out at the lighthouse
that was a
that was a very pesky Canadian fly and he bit me
well
I guess he was hungry
I don't think he was just trying to be mean and nasty
he was hungry
speaking of being hungry Naima what else are you gonna eat
you gonna eat some more penne pasta
good
I think Mommy put some crab salad there too
there's crab
you're a lucky king fisher
is it possible to know which clothes you're gonna wear tomorrow
yes it is it's gonna be the black cords and the long sleeve black teeshirt
belts and socks and undies yep
actually I don't know if undies are in there
well I packed
yeah but you packed three
who's in the dell
the zipper in the dell
the zipper in the dell
hi ho the zippio
that's good the zippio the zipper's in the dell
that's pretty funny
that's what the
you did
what did the rising tide say to Naima
'cause that tide was coming up higher higher and higher and higher
because the tide was coming in
the water was rising and the water was coming in
and the water saw Naima and the water said I'm gonna get you
'cause the tide was rising
the tide rises twice a day
yeah
twice a day
that's two times
why
the moon pulls the water around
'cause the moon
uhoh another
is that
it's probably that same pesky fly
oh good idea
shoo it away
don't worry it's not a big deal Boo
forget the fly
it's just a fly
it's just a fly
we could open the door and it might fly out but in fact another fly might come in instead so
yes Boo
you think we should open the door
yeah don't worry
you want to thwack it
oh dear
oh dear
I think that fly flew away
oh I don't want to be a fly swatter today
oh it's just kinda boring
it's boring
Naima you know what
just forget the fly don't worry about it
flies aren't that important
they're just not very important
it's not that you can shoo sheep
I mean you can kind of guide sheep to go to a certain place like you could make sheep go out a certain door but you can't make a fly go out a certain door
it's much harder
it takes great skill to herd a fly
why
'cause flies
oh I got a fly bite because
that was like
I don't know what kind of fly that was
it was a biting kind of a fly
it was a Canadian kind of a biting fly
those were the kind of flies Daddy used to get bit by all through the summer when I was working in the woods
why am I Canadian
'cause that's where Babaji and Dadiji went
they came from India
they came from India and they went to Canada
so Daddy's a Canadian
what's
oh
cats do that don't they
cats hiss
that cat was hissing at when the bears came in and ate all the blueberries in that story
when Bessie Ann
no
was it Bessie Ann
Bessie Allen
Bessie Allen and the dog and the cat came back into the house and the bears had gone the cat looked at her bowl and she hissed
just like that
are you gonna eat some food my dear
what
I thought you were hungry
would you like some salty cheese
would you like some
there's pasta right there
I see plenty of pasta
okay let's get you some salty cheese Booboo
Booboo needs some salty cheese
okay salty cheese coming right up
'cause it's coming right up
here it comes
that means coming right away
oh you love the salty cheese don't you
it is delicious
it is delicious reggiano

yummy yummy yumuh
salty cheese
Daddy had no idea when he was a kid
this was so good
did you not like it as a kid
no I mean you know I had Kraft
I had this sort of
that
yeah
that stuff
yep
it was before the explosion of gourmet thinking in the country
Cheez Whiz
I had quite a lot of Cheez Whiz in my time
Cheez Whiz
sad to say it's made me the woman I am today

you're eating salty cheese and pasta
and I
oh my gosh you need more tomato sauce
why didn't Daddy think of that
silly Daddy
mm
and that means we need a spoon
I know but I need a spoon for the tomato sauce
'cause sauce is better spooned out than forked out
'cause it's more liquidy
there what d'you say to that
oh dear you need a spoon too
why
I thought you needed a fork
you don't
you gonna use your fingers
mm mm
wow already packed huh
so Boo
did you have a good day
you were very upset earlier weren't you
d'you remember that
I think 'cause you hadn't had a nap and you were really really tired
d'you remember
you were really
that was a
that's what's called a tantrum
remember you were asking what's a tantrum
remember we read that book and those alligators were having a tantrum
and you wanted to know what's a tantrum
what you were having today was a tantrum
you just couldn't control yourself you were so upset
I think you hadn't had enough sleep
you did
you didn't
you didn't want to go to the restaurant I know
but Mommy and Daddy
wanted to get a little tea
well we felt like it was getting a bit chilly and we wanted a little tea
you really didn't want to go to the restaurant I know
well I
we couldn't really figure out what you wanted
mm
oh my gosh what
she walks away from her daddy
an alligator walks away from her daddy
oh the alligator baby
oh
you think that's why that other
that baby alligator's having a tantrum
in that picture
huh
why is that
oh you don't want the crab huh
oh well
hm we don't have any yogurt
I wonder what else Naima would like to eat
we'll see if there's anything else good to eat in here
Naima Boo there's more applesauce
there's soy milk
oh soy milk might be nice
there's smoothie
oh Naima
would you like some smoothie
I thought you might
oh good
okay you can move it out of the way
I'm gonna help you drink this
this is all that's left of the smoothie
mm
you didn't try all of these yet
this one is incredible I think
no I didn't
which one
the one you didn't have
oh it just looked like sticky caramel
no but
it's not caramel though
oh oh I see
just have a tiny bit
I see
it's not caramel
it's some kind of
liqueur or something
well
I don't know what
it's really good
and actually I didn't get this and I forgot to find out what it's called
told me but I forgot
see it's not caramel at all
what did I see that was sticky
mm mm mm mm mm mm
I don't know
I'm not sure what you're talking about
when
you know
I don't know what you're talking about
what did Daddy see that was sticky
what did I think was sticky
you mean the caramel
what I'm talking to Mommy about
oh Mommy bought some chocolate that I thought was sticky
you want to take this smoked salmon with us
I don't
it's old enough
it's not that great
it's okay I mean it
yeah it's okay just
it's not fabulous
I mean basically
and then
we're gonna have breakfast here

I know
I mean for me you know there's a smidge of cereal which I can finish

where
oh you're right there's a hair on your hands too
oh I didn't get it
hold on
where is it

poor mister fly
oh Daddy there must be a fly over your way somewhere
oh another fly another fly
where
thank you

why
nothing from the New England Journal but
I've been getting spammed by Herb Chambers ever since I sent a
innocent inquiry three months ago
oh
and they're always like
media rich files so they just clog everything up
hm
I hope they
okay
is Naima gonna take a bath
yes that's what I've been trying to tell you
you've been trying to tell me
pinch pinch pinch
I'm
I'm asking Naima
pinch pinch pinch
Naima are you gonna take a bath
yeah
I know there's a fly
I'm not too worried about it though
he did
oh that's a different kind of fly
it's not the same kind that's flying around in here right now
that's a different kind of fly
these little flies don't bite
that was a mangy Canadian fly
okay let's see here
ooh Alistair Campbell resigned

fall guy for Blair
yes I know
you knew that
I didn't know that
I heard it on the

did I really
did I sing Goldilocks
I did
caught out
I think Naima's [
Naima's [
maybe I did in the car

yes
hey are you ready to come down
or are you still eating
you're still eating
you have some very nice looking apple there
and some
oh you don't
even though it's nice almond butter with apples

Daddy'll get all that stuff off of you
let's stop recording
that's fine
if you just take the I'll stop it
you wanna get all that stuff off now
or in the bath
okay I think that's a good idea
just take your own off forget
forget about turning it off I'll
you'll take care of the rest
I'll do the rest
okay
