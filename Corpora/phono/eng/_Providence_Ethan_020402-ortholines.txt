I see that
just like Muck did
Muck and Travis
in the story
that s right
but what happened to Muck
he couldn t sleep
because he got scared of the dark
Diesel squeezed by them
over them
he rumbled over them
and almost woke them up from their sleep
he s rumbling
it makes a lotta noise when a train goes over a bridge
what is that noise
said Trevor
oh no
and then the bridge broke
then that really woke them up didn t it
no they weren t
it was too noisy
and too many things were falling down
come in
from inside the door there was a boom
that s Stephanie
you ve never seen her before have you
you can give her your box now
yeah it did make them wake up didn t it
it was too noisy
they went back inside the sheds to fall asleep
shh
and they began snoring again
in time to the crickets
hm
it s dark and cozy in there
oh no
they keep waking up
oh no
mhm
he decided he would carry a barrel of oil
mhm fuel from the depot heh
that s right
and oil to the docks
here are the docks
because it s near the water
Butch jumped into the water
maybe he was hot
he needed to go for a swim
mhm
mm
he helped anyway
that s good of him
that was nice of him to help anyway
he splashed into the river
splash splash splash
oop
is Trevor helping out this time
he pulled him outta the water
now he needs to be dried off
maybe he just can sit in the sun and dry off
oh he s feeling hot again
oh no
he wants to go back in the water
he says let go of me Trevor
I wanna go in the
oh

whoops
that s like one of your stories where James is up on the bridge
oh help wailed James
he s not gonna stand up again

you could load him into one of the trucks
and they could carry him since he s flat
he s flat
yep

James can get a ride
yeah Kirby s been in the shed all night long I think
down by the station
Terence s sleepover
except dyou know what Ethan
that s Trevor
Trevor s sleepover
you mix them up too

Buster Butch and Trevor
and Terence too
Terence can be in the sleepover can t he
you can have three people in a sleepover
or three trains
there we go
take the caboose away
don t you think
you know what we could do
we could put tissues like blankets
so they each can sleep in the dark
mm now put that over Butch
here we go
and here s one
one for each of them
there we go
yeah now they can sleep peacefully
nobody can see them and they can t see anybody
now wake up time
then they fall asleep again
Diesel was curious about all the blankets over the tracks
he said what could be happening under there
surprise
he said
wake up time
Terence comes in yep
and they ask each other did you have a good night s sleep
did you sleep well
not a wink
said
said Trevor
not a wink said Rusty
I mean Terence
not a wink said Butch
big engines need big sheds
