we may have to bring sweatshirts to the beach
it's gonna be chilly
ooh animals in it
ah yeah
did you see this
okay
are you gonna be my guy
okay
look what this says
what does that say
you know what my zebra's gonna do he's gonna
yep looks like a squirrel to me
he's gonna jump over the fence watch this
pretty good huh
can anyone else jump over the fence
he can
whoa
he can swing over the fence yeah
this guy's gonna sniff the fence
hey I'm stuck in the fence
dogs can jump
yeah I think I knew that
there's another fence too
he'll be jumping over like this
why do you think she grabs it back if you grab it
we have to teach her how not to grab stuff
you have this one
oh okay
wait until she's done doing what she's doing and then we'll do that
oh all those guys are gonna jump over
ooh he jumps like that high the dog
I mean I don't think he's a dog I think he might be a wolf
well he's at the zoo right
they are
oh is that the cut you got from grandma's house
oh when you hurt your foot on the door
okay let him set up the fences for a minute
let's have them all jumping over the fences watch this
everybody above the fences
but they might crash in the air
wouldn't they
he's gonna protect him
Chloe's
Chloe when Chloe sees it she goes
she's funny isn't she Chloe
you don't think the lion could jump
I don't think the crocodile could jump
he could bite through it though
or knock it down
with his tail
maybe
but I don't think he could jump over it do you
he could hook it
watch he could
hook it
and drag it away
what
yeah
mhm
we know the monkey could swing over it
the monkey's hanging from the zoo side
see
welcome to the zoo
welcome welcome
yeah piggybacks yeah
put me on
and these guys will do piggyback on here
whoa that lion is heavy for that zebra
hop on my back and we'll jump across
now now pretend these
are just the gates to get inside to the zoo and then this is the zoo inside of here
so they all live in here
okay
you going to work
where do you work
ooh what do yo do at your office
what kind of work do you do in your office
boy
everybody's working here
what do you do in your
what do you do Mr Lion
oh boy
do you eat all the meat at the butcher shop Mr Lion
I'm surprised
oh
yeah but when you moved
when you pulled that wire you moved the thing
so I had to fix it
I'm gonna go find some more zebras
look they can stick on the couch
because the couch has same felt
see
pretty cool huh
can I see this board for a minute I just wanna see what this says
I wanna see what it has on this side
it says find a fish that's different from the other ones
it's a game on that board
that is looking at
don't pull it from your brother he's holding it
well look at it with him and see
hold it flat down so she can look too
don't touch it just look
it says find the fish that's different from the other one's
which fish is different from the others
hm
it's hard to tell because there's
well I have an idea
this one
because of the color he has
maybe yeah
yeah
that's the one then
you think so
and look what he has on his fin he doesn't have those three little marks on his fin like all the other ones do
see
he doesn't have any
right
see that bean
are you my bean
on this side
well this side's a little tough it says find the words hidden in here
you gotta find the word fish swim whale water friends and shell all in this thing
if you look up here it tells you how they're spelled
W A T E R is water you gotta find W A T E R
like here's an example see this one that says fish
F I S H there's fish
here look for a W
is there an a near it
nope look for another W then
is there an a near it
nope look for another W
is there an a near it
is there a t
W A
W A T E R water
it's tricky because it can go like diagonally and up and down
now you look for the word shell
S H E L L
see if you can find it
you find it
nope that's not it try another S
nope I see another S
on the top row
nope another one on the top row
yeah shell he found it
whale okay
W H A L E
W looks like that
mhm
mhm
you found it
honey that's a
but you know what
that's when you have to be five to know how to do this one because it's hard to
you have to know your letters to do this game
do you know your letters
let's see if you can find a letter let's see if can find a letter x
don't don't help her
can you find a letter x
okay you find whale then
