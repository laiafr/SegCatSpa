*MOT:	my name is Becky , and I live near the New_York public library . 39781_43570
*MOT:	some buildings in New_York make you feel small . 43571_46531
*MOT:	but walking up the steps of the library makes me feel important . 46531_50675
*MOT:	we should go to the library next time we're in . 50675_52826
*MOT:	wouldn't that be a great idea ? 52826_53915
*MOT:	it's like walking up the steps of a palace , especially if you walk exactly in the middle . 53915_60651
*MOT:	xxx all the people . 60653_64471
*MOT:	the library was my favorite place in New_York when we first moved here . 64471_68661

*MOT:	if I could figure out how to get there . 82566_84713
*MOT:	for my first expedition , I wanted to see real animals . 84713_88660
*MOT:	finding a zoo on the map was easy . 88660_90803
*MOT:	knowing where I was on the map , and which way to walk to the zoo was a little harder . 90803_96038
*MOT:	but I finally figured it out by turning the map . 96038_102958
*MOT:	once the map and I were both facing the same direction , finding the zoo was easy . 102958_107765
*MOT:	have you been to the zoo ? 107765_108895
*MOT:	yes you have . 108895_110275
*MOT:	one good thing about New_York is that most of the streets are numbered in order . 110275_113708
*MOT:	the numbers go up as you go north , and down as you go south . 113708_116798
*MOT:	it's very logical . 116798_117935
*MOT:	so we just walked straight on fifth avenue . 117935_120708
*MOT:	I know I was going the right way because the numbers kept going up . 120708_123341
*MOT:	and at sixty fourth street , we turned left . 123341_125948
*MOT:	sometimes zoos make you feel sorry for the animals that live in them , but at this one , most of the animals aren't in cages . 125948_131860
*MOT:	the penguins have rocks to climb on , and make their nests with , and a pool to swim in . 131860_136488
*MOT:	you can stand right next to the glass and see under the water ! 136488_139748
*MOT:	they were my favorites , but I also liked watching the insects . 139748_143385
