sort of a joke
I don't think
sort of a joke
sort of
you can see his new car you've never watched him drive away in his new car
you've only watched him drive away in his old car
he's waving to you
because he's waving byebye
baddy baddy baddy baddy
is that his name
oh that's his new car
he's driving his new car away
it sounds different doesn't it
it has a different noise than the old car
byebye Daddy with his new car
what this
or this
or this
oh this
that's a clothes pin
it's a special kind of magnet clothes pin
did you like using clothes pins this morning
that was fun
we could actually bring a few to and I mean rather to
and house this morning so you can keep practicing
would you like to do that
we could bring some doll clothes and you could hang them
mhm
I dunno if has legos
you wanna see what his toys look like
yeah he might have some interesting toys
he's a little toddler but he still might have some toys that are fun to play with but I do think we should bring our own toys
well because I don't know for sure if his toys are gonna be fun to play with because he's littler than you
because he is sixteen months old
and you are how many months are you now
let's see is this June July
March April May June July
four months
so sixteen weeks plus twenty
no twenty four months plus four
you are twenty eight months old Naima
you're twenty almost twenty eight months old and is sixteen months old
I'm gonna
I'm gonna bring some grapes to play group
oh that would be very interesting I wonder what his high chair looks like
well we're not going to house
and and are probably going to come to house just like we are
we're going to and house
yeah we could ask to show us
we could ask to show us
and you know what they live near the South Yarmouth library
where we used to go
to listen to stories
remember who used to be there the librarian
do you remember her
she used to sing welcome welcome everyone now you're here we'll have some fun
used to be in that story group
library group
remember that
yeah when you were a littler but you weren't really well you were a baby when you started
but then you were a little toddler when we still used to go there
you used to do trot trot to Boston trot trot to you better watch out or you might fall in
remember doing that
at the library
and you used to do it with sometimes too
let's see
and who else was in that library group do you remember the other
when you were a bigger toddler
or when you were a little toddler
you're a big toddler now
well
you did go to a toddler group after we stopped going to that library group
where Jane used to come and read stories and then there was a craft
you did that a couple of times
there were a lot of children there do you remember
I don't remember we only went to that twice I think
so I didn't really learn their names
if we have time we could go to the South Yarmouth Library after our play group and see if they have the Bear Family book and check it out
would you like to do that
I thought so
Waldo is in that book
is Waldo the Grandpa bear
maybe you're right
I thought he was I thought he was Uncle Waldo
you want some more grape
with a towel
do you think bears use towels
I think they might just shake themselves off likes dogs do
because it's easier than having to have a towel
they do what
what do bears do
bear potties
bear parties
or bear potties
which
bear parties
bear potties
oh
bears actually don't use potties at all do they
they just poop in the forest
and the baby bear poops in the forest too
or in the meadow
because animals don't
animals don't use potties except cats who live in the house use cat potties
yup
I don't think that animals do that's a rule for people
that they need to wash their hands when they poop or pee
after they poop or pee
well animals don't usually do that although cats and some animals do clean themselves up after they poop or pee in the potty
I am looking for
oh there's pictures of pee pee and poop in that animal pee pee and poop
well you tell me what do oops
something came tumbling out of the freezer because our freezer has so much junk in it
I might pack some other lunch things for you because if we have lunch with Daddy then we'll need to have more stuff
you spilled some milk just now
oh okay that's not a big deal
I'm not worried about it
I'm gonna clean it up anyway
this cheese that I'm gonna pack up for
no not for for you to eat either at snack time or lunch time
what do you mean no
cheddar cheese
which you like
it's called cheddar cheese
it is sharp cheddar cheese
it's organic sharp cheddar cheese
it is organic
it's for you to eat at lunch time or snack time
you don't have to I'll eat it if you don't eat it
somebody else who else
what friends are we gonna see in our play group

oh thank you for reminding me I almost forgot that I had that
we do have to bring that
oh is that what you're doing
oh
I think you're ready to get out of the chair now aren't you
well I don't really like having ants in my kitchen
well I just don't
I don't like having insects in my kitchen very much
well a kitchen is a place that needs to be kept clean and most insects are not very clean
okay sweetie pie girl
oh okay Sweetie Bear
something bad
you mean the butter
does the butter taste bad to you
oh sorry to hear that
oh thank you for reminding me again
I know I was gonna forget that
let's see
are you gonna ask him to show it to you
you're gonna ask his mommy
mm okay I think we'll start this up again later that was just seventeen minutes on Wednesday July ninth
oh I think there is a picture where there are children at a play ground
is it the top first picture
I think it's that first picture right there
are they at a play ground
looks like they're on a they're playing on swings
what else are those children doing
should we add some words to these books
we could write some words
oh do you remember who made these books
yes we did
why are they home made books
because we made them at home
we need to snap these
get these snapped
is that in your way
let me adjust it a little for you
well I'd kinda like to leave it on you for just a little while while we're taping
recording
let's keep looking at the books
what do we see here
should we write the names of these animals in the book
I guess we need either a crayon or a magic marker to do that
you wanna learn how to write
because why
oh you don't
I see
let's see if I can get this off
a boogie board
was there a girl with a boogie board at the beach
I thought we were gonna go get magic markers so that we could write words in those books that we made yesterday
you're gonna learn how to write okay
okay
okay
I see with the magic marker okay
oh let's get the magic marker
you know we could use crayons
why are you upset
yes I'm getting the magic markers
you want some paper
alright
should we write down
you want some crayons okay
crayons are good
and we certainly have some
you don't want what
oh
okay I'll put the markers away
take all these crayons with us to the living room
a piece of what
yeah this is paper right here
yeah there are ants in the kitchen
I don't like ants in my kitchen okay
so here's some crayons
and you want to learn how to write some words you said
you want me to write the words
well I could write them and you could practice
practicing is good too
that's a yellow crayon
isn't it
oh you're taking that page out
okay
alright
well you can still write on it though look it's good to write on
why don't you write on that
well you need to write on a hard surface like this
that's a nice hard surface and you could put here you could put this down
you could draw on that one
what color crayons should I use to write the names of the animals
okay
okay orange
should I write eagle here
you can just leave that alone okay
just leave it alone just ignore it
that means don't pay attention
okay I'm gonna write
eagle right here
do you know how to spell eagle
you wanna practice writing
e a g l e
oh see it
or you wanna practice
using the clothes pins now
looks like you're using the clothes pins
yup we can do this later when
oh did that clothes pin break
alright I'll see if I can fix that
well it's broken right so why don't you give it to me and I'll see if I can put it back together
okay
you didn't think it was delicate I think
but it was a little bit delicate
okay
what are you doing
you're putting clothes pins there
how about putting them on this side now
because there's more room here
hm
it's not easy is it
you did it there
should we do it together
yeah
I see that
I think that's the other part why don't you give that one to me
remember push and clip
mhm yeah
push
push
and clip
it's not easy on that side when it's on that side
I think you're doing a pretty good job actually
hm there that one's fixed
which fingers am I using
that's right
mhm
I like these new clothes pins they're so
new and clean and they're in these nice colors
blue and white
hello
hello
it's like a mouth
that end of the clothes pin looks like an animals mouth like a crocodile
hello
squeak
squeak squeak squeak
do you wanna try hanging up the dolls clothes with the clothes pins
on a
I'm trying to think
what we could use a clothes make a little clothes line in the house
oh do you know how to take them off
you squeeze them again when you get them off
you squeeze with your fingers index or thumb
watch Mommy do it
watch
squeeze
squeeze when it comes off
squeeze and open when you take it off
can you practice taking it off too
squeeze
and open yeah
squeeze and open
squeeze open pull up
squeeze open pull up
one at a time one at a time it's easier
watch Mommy do it
squeeze open pull up
you have to squeeze at the top right up here
squeeze there
okay I'm just trying to think whether we have anything like a clothes line in the house
oh I know we have that twine that I was using for the garden
how about if I get that
where can we tie it here in the living room
don't step on that please
because I don't want you to step on it
really
you do like to step on your pony why do you like to step on your pony
because he's mad
do you do that when you're feeling mad
who's crying
why is Naima crying
why is Naima crying
the what
the twine yeah
I'm just trying to think where we're gonna put the twine
how about
oh you know we could do it over there at the fire place if we clean the toys away a little bit
lemme get a big piece of twine
okay
let's a let's clip that on to you
actually you know what you have a great little pocket
you can put it right there in the
hey I think that's the garbage truck
do you wanna see it
okay
let's go see
oh here I'll lift you up
here it is
what color is it
blue
it looks black to me
what color lights does it have
yeah
there he is
yes
green green buckets of garbage
it's a big truck
yay
he's very strong
byebye garbage truck
byebye
the truck takes the garbage to the dump
okay
there's water in the dump truck
oh you're talking about your toy dump truck
the twine is right here
and I'm going to put the clothes line for the doll clothes right here
yup and we have to clean the toys up so that you can stand there and hang those
clothes with the clothes pins
I'm gonna help you do that
in just a second
oh let's clean them up in a nice neat way though okay
I don't want just everything dumped in the living room ouch
because I hit my foot that's why
yes thank you
you're right
I do like a nice neat room oh I see what you're doing
you're straightening up
for Daddy to stand
for you to stand
where is yeah
now the other thing we need to do is to find the
doll clothes
why don't you put these things
over where the
here this too
where the tool box is
that's where those things belong
they belong with the tool box
well we're straightening up so that you have room
to put the
doll clothes
hanging up there with the
yeah
can you just why don't you practice by just putting a clothes pin on that line
can you do that
do it the same way you do it on the box you have to hold the top of the clothes pin
push
and then clip
can I show you
okay watch my fingers push
there yeah and it hangs upside down like that
okay the way you take it off
push
and there
okay what
find the doll clothes you need to find them before you hang them up
here's something to hang up
where are the rest of the doll clothes
for hanging up
seems to me you need to find some more
okay this is what we're gonna do
put it here and now you can push
just like you did it on the box the same way but you have to point it down
it's upside down
okay watch Mommy do it
push
and clip
and this is gonna move but that's okay
it doesn't matter
you need to use words to say what you want
put it up right
it doesn't matter
we can't put it up right because the twine is too small
if it were thicker twine then it would stay up right I think
oh yeah
do you wanna get some more doll clothes and hang them up to dry
why don't you look in your room and see if there's some in there
hey look what I found under the lego table
okay
this is tricky you gotta hold that with one hand
and hold the clothes pin with your other hand
want me to hold the clothes up for you
yeah you were doing a good job
okay
push a little more on the top of the clothes pin
you wanna do it on the floor
you know you can hang the clothes up right on the box where you've been putting the clothes pins
take the clothes over to the box
let me have it
I wanna show you
I wanna show you
you don't want me to show you
oh okay
I could show you and then you could try it after I do it
that's how you learn things
you watch someone do it
oh
I see
what happened
what happened
the other
yeah the other hair clip
the green one is in your hair
this one
you had both of them in your hair
I'm getting your hair outta your eyes that's good it'll make it easier to play
do you wanna have a snack
want some grapes
you're gonna go in the tunnel okay
well I'm gonna straighten up a little bit here
do you wanna write the words in the book with me
oh I see
are we in a bad mood now
do you want some snack bar
do you want some frozen
cherries
yeah
are you feeling upset
why don't you have a bottle of milk or something

grape juice

are you sure you don't want some baby yogurt with grape
alright six six more and that's it
okay
okay
poor you poor you
alright alright

okay
baby yogurt no
I think a little food would be a good idea
it willn't it won't be good
how about some smoothie
oh alright you want me to read that while you're eating and drinking
we could do that
yessie
then we'll come back and straighten up the living room
when we're done
let's go in here and have a little snack and I'll read the book to you how's that
is that what you want
right why don't you pick something out of the refrigerator
alright do you want baby yogurt because it's way in the back somewhere
oh okay what do you want
tofu
these are the grapes
and there's cheese
and hummus
and there's wheat shreds
that's milk
okay hummus to eat
smoothie to drink
you got it
you got it
it is snack time anyway
it certainly is snack time
it is
we need to buy more smoothie remember we went to the store yesterday and they didn't have the right kind of smoothie
they just didn't
that store doesn't carry that kind of smoothie I was very disappointed
yeah there is a picture of a cow right there
bah
that's what cows say
bah and gah
are you sure that's what cows say
really
I don't think so
I think cows say moo
they don't
cows say bah that's a good joke
oh that's not a joke
oh
snow sled
quite a long time ago
that one
oh
yeah we did buy a snow sled at the toy store
that was a long time ago
who wants to play in the snow with that
well if it snows I'll definitely give you that to play with
I'm gonna give you a smoothie
smoothie
let's put it in here
you want a paper cup
alright
you better use both hands
are you gonna have the hummus too
it's Mommy Day today
I didn't know it was Mommy Day
use both hands with that
Mommy Day
hm
do you wanna little cracker with your hummus or are you just gonna just use the spoon
okay I think you wanna try this kinda cracker
Akmak
with sesame seeds on it
mm
crunchy and good
Akmak
that's the kinda crackers they are
Akmak
Akmak
oh I heard a birdie
I thought it was a vulture
actually I didn't think that was a vulture
it doesn't sound like a vulture I'm gonna drink some orange juice
while you're having your snack
yeah
yeah because I'm thirsty
that's exactly what I was doing
how did you know that
what does the police man say to Corduroy
he says how did you get up here
why does he say that
yeah Corduroy went up the escalator all by himself
that's very strange for a little bear to do that all by himself
or herself
because bears don't usually walk around department stores all by themselves after dark
they might get lost
he did get a little bit lost didn't he
yes
he was trying to look for the button
well
because he knows that the people who are in the store who want to buy a little bear he hears them say that they want bears who don't have lost buttons they want bears who already have their buttons
let's see here
wow you polished that right up didn't you
hungry girl
here's a bit more
oh boy
want some more akh makh too
you like that huh
that's how the akh makh is made
it's made with sesame seeds on it
that's just how it's made
did you have fun this morning
where did we go
do you remember
whose house did we go to
house
that was fun
and you wanted to see what his high chair looked like
and you saw it
looks like a restaurant high chair doesn't it
it looks the same kinda restaurant high chair that restaurants usually use
well he has one that's like a restaurant high chair but he uses it at home
what did you say
you're interesting
mhm
what are they called do you remember
akh makh yes
more smoothie
smoothie
smoothie
you're helping me okay
you've never seen what
you've never seen a Mommy duckling kissing her mommy duck
you've never seen a duckling hug her Mommy
why
what do ducks eat
I think they eat little plants that grow in the water
mostly
I dunno if ducks eat insects I'd like to find out
I think we should find out
maybe I'll write that we have a list of questions on the board
and one would be do ducks what do ducks eat
that's a very good question
I will write it down on our question sheet right now
our list of questions
what do ducks eat
I dunno I'm gonna find out for you
they live near the water
I think they drink water from ponds or lakes or
rivers
oh
just from lakes
I think we should go to Cape Cod Natural Foods
when you're done with your snack
so that we can buy more smoothie
because
because
we're out almost out of smoothie
you're about to you're about to finish
the last smoothie
and we also need some
canola oil
and fish sticks
yeah
you wanna eat drink some more
there's a little bit left
let's see
yeah okay
that's the end of it though
all gone
it's all gone
well how about drinking more smoothie
I heard you say that
but a smoothie is for drinking not for washing
it just is
okay Mommy's gonna make chili tonight
to eat chili is a food we eat it's spicy beans
yeah
what
you're a silly willy
who's a silly willy
mhm I'm cutting
hot peppers here
I'm gonna freeze these hot peppers
to use later or maybe I'll
use a little more of them now
I'm cutting those hot peppers
well they're very very hot and spicy so I don't wanna
cause you to sneeze excessively
there we go
we're gonna put these in the freezer
say excuse me
you burped and it's good manners to say excuse me when you burp
yeah
excuse me
it's empty
okay
no smoothie in there
there is
I thought it was all gone
dripping it
no smoothie
you still eating your hummus or are you finished with it
oh okay
what is that cracker called
remember
well I am still drinking it
because it's thirsty I'm thirsty
and I
wanna keep healthy
I'm not eating anything right now
I'm just drinking orange juice
there's no Daddy downstairs
you know where he is and what he's doing I think
yeah
he's gonna help people feel better
patients
what do you think
you know the answer to that question
he's gonna check their hearts oops
well I just realized that your bib and your microphone fell down
some time ago perhaps
there
he's gonna listen to their hearts with a stethoscope
what else does he do to help them feel better Naima
he looks in their ears with an otoscope
I don't think he does that a lot but I think once in a while maybe he does that
he figures out what kind of medicine they need
I'm cooking onions and garlic
and green hot spicy peppers
because I'm making chili
and chili's also gonna have black beans in it
and tomatoes
and we're gonna eat it for supper later on
you'll have chili
well right now it's just onions it's not that interesting
but
when it's all cooking everything's in it you can have a look at it
your hand's going away
oh it's very dark outside isn't it
I think it's overcast
you think it's gonna snow or rain
it doesn't really snow in the summer
just summer is not a time when there's snow
winter fall and spring are the only time when it snows
house
what was he doing there
he was actually he was giving you little hugs
he wanted to touch you and give you hugs
and he actually give you a kiss on your back he's a very sneaky kisser
he likes to sneak up behind people and kiss them on the back of their head
well he's little
he's a little bit shy I think
oh hm
it does fit
no
what's not working
oh
yeah that's not really a very important part of the
top
I think I'll call
it has what on it
hi it's
how are you
just a little spit I think
yeah
I was wondering if it's too late to order for tomorrow
okay
okay
okay
great
well the broccoli was fabulous
we'll definitely take some more broccoli
two two
I'd take two or three bunches I mean it depends on how many you wanna get rid of
yes
yeah
okay
do you have lettuce these days
okay
we'd like lettuce
I think actually like two smaller bunches would be better than one big bunch
but we take whatever you have
yeah okay
okay
well that's fine either way
I yeah
I think just the way you normally have it is fine
I think that's fine
oh do you
do you have any peas yet or is that still a ways off
okay
okay
okay
yup
so what else might you have
you're not sure
I would take a few I actually still have some from last week but
I'll take maybe just four leaves of that
oh flat I'll take another bunch of flat that was really good too
that has a lot of vitamin c in it as you may know
I think not actually
yeah
yeah I'll try that
I guess
if you have some
yeah
yeah
okay
what kind of cabbage do you have
mhm
okay
that's fine
I can wait I actually have some at home right now so
