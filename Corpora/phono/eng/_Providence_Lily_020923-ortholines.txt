climb on up
what book is this called
the Lion king
can I have a kiss
I love you
can I have a hug
mm
every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
this is Pride rock
home to my good friend king
who is that
that's king Mufasa
and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had come to Pride rock to celebrate the birth of their newborn cub Simba
as part of the celebration I had a special duty
I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
then I lifted the future king up high for all to see
the elephants trumpeted with their trunks the monkeys jumped up and down and the zebras stamped their hoofs with happiness
what animals do you see
you're right where are the monkeys
here they are and what else do you see
uhhuh
and what else
the elephants and do you remember what this is
what kind of animal is that
I think it might be a mandrill
think so
not far from the ceremony in a cave at the back side of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled life's not fair I shall never be king
who's that
that's Mufasa's brother Scar who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba he said
Zazu Mufasa's trusted advisor also appeared
you should have been first in line
I was first in line until that little hair ball was born he said and Scar stalked out of the cave
that's Zazu
he's a bird right
uhhuh
before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
look Simba he said everything the light touches is our kingdom
Simba scanned the horizon and noticed a dark spot in the distance
what about that shadowy place
that's beyond our borders you must never go there Simba
but I thought a king can do whatever he wants
there's more to being king than getting your way all the time
everything you see exists together in a delicate balance
as king you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope
we're all connected in the great Circle of life
later as Simba headed back down the path he ran into Scar
hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride rock
my dad showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all
Scar looked slyly at the young cub
he didn't show you what's beyond that rise of the northern border
well no he said I couldn't go there
oh he's right it's far too dangerous
only the bravest lions go there
hello
when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
come on I just heard about this great place
the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them
Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird
they led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him
once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala
then Nala flipped Simba onto his back
they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
Simba looked around and gasped
this is it we made it
but before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down
we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands and right now we are all in very real danger
who's that
who are those
what kind of animals are they
are they cows
are they horses
what are they
are they mice
are they deer
moose
kitty cats
what are they
they're hyenas
hyenas
aren't they hyenas
yeah
do hyenas laugh a lot
yes
what are their names
do you remember one name
one of the hyena's names
Mary
Joe
Bobo
what did Maria say that day to Tamar at the play ground
Toma Toma
you're very giggly today
okay do you remember any of their names
why are you so what's so silly
what's so funny Banzai
Shenzi
and the always laughing Ed
Banzai grabbed Zazu by the neck and plopped him down
hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
what's the hurry we'd love you to stick around for dinner
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Simba Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away
but the hyenas weren't distracted for long
they gave chase and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could
finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones
just when it looked as if it were all over for the young cubs Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with one swipe of his big paw
if you ever come near my son again he said
the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba
you deliberately disobeyed me I'm very disappointed
Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son
Simba peered up at his father
I was just trying to be brave like you
well their home is back in the Pride lands but right now they're just looking at the ah at the stars right
are they twinkly
sparkly
do you still have all three rings
mhm
wow nice
Dad we're pals right and we'll always be together right said Simba
Mufasa looked up at the stars
Simba let me tell you something my father told me
look at the stars
great kings of the past look down on us from these stars
so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
meanwhile the hyenas received another visitor
an angry Scar showed up at their lair
I practically gift wrapped those cubs and you couldn't even dispose of them he said
Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared
be prepared for what Banzai laughed
for the death of the king said Scar
the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
now you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly
well he has some hair on his head
mhm
ahhah
Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba
they've just a tiny little tiny bit of hair
and ears too they have ears too right
right
hm hm hm
goodness
from a distance Mufasa noticed the rising dust
Scar appeared quickly at his side
stampede in the gorge Simba's down there
without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son
I guess he'd have to jump
Mufasa plunged into the gourd and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
he found Simba grabbed him the nape of his neck and pulled him onto a nearby ledge
but suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him
help me Brother he said
Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper in his ear long live the king and let go of Mufasa
Simba peered over the ridge just as his father disappeared beneath the thundering stampede
later Scar found Simba hovering over his father sobbing
it was an accident I didn't mean for it to happen
what am I going to do
run away Simba said Scar run away and never return
Simba told did as he was told unaware that his uncle's hyena friends had been ordered to finish him off
Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne
meanwhile Simba plodded across the Savanna without any food or water
it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot hot sun
as the vultures circled overhead a big hearted wart hog named Pumbaa stumbled upon the lion
he turned to his trusty pal a fast talking meerkat named Timon
he's so cute and all alone can we keep him
Pumbaa are you nuts lions eat guys like us
but Pumbaa scooped Simba him up anyway and carried him to safety
when Simba awoke the first thing that sprang to his mind was his father
Timon taught him about hakuna matata which means no responsibilities and no worries
you've got to put your past behind you he said and that's exactly what Simba did
he stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion
but eventually he got homesick
and one night he looked at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him a long time ago
the next day Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness
who is that
who's that
it's Nala
Nala what are you doing here
why didn't you come back to Pride rock you're the king she said
I'm not the king Scar is
Simba he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands there's no food or water and if you don't come back soon everyone will be in trouble you're our only hope
I can't go back
Simba yelled at the heavens you said you'd always be there for me but you're not
because of me
Simba didn't believe he could challenge Scar to the throne so he stayed in the jungle with Nala and his new friends
but I knew the time had come for Simba to take his place in the circle of life and I headed for the jungle
when Simba saw me he was surprised
who are you
question is I asked who are you
I thought I knew but now I'm not so sure
well I know who you are you're Mufasa's boy
I led Simba to a reflecting pool
when he looked in the water he saw a lion
that's not my father it's just my reflection
look harder he lives in you I said
the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared
look inside yourself Simba you are more than what you have become
you must take your place in the Circle of life
that's the ghost of his father of king Mufasa
yeah well scary but he's still nice
he looks a little scary but he's still very nice
yeah
when Simba arrived back at Pride rock he found the land bare and dry
the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother
suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba
Scar jumped back
Simba I'm a little surprised to see you alive
give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart said Simba
Scar started to slink off but he turned and lunged one last time at Simba
Simba moved quickly and flipped Scar over the edge where a pack of hyenas were waiting hungrily
limping badly Simba climbed to the top of Pride rock
he let out a magnificent roar as he looked over his kingdom
before long Pride rock flourished again
Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had their own newborn cub
with their friends around including Zazu Pumbaa and Timon a new celebration of life took place
after making a mark on the forehead of the young cub I held him up for all the kingdom to see
oh let's read a different book Sweetie pie

Ariel and who's that
wow
one morning the little mermaid Ariel went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend Flounder
Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father king Triton and the other mer people
but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
what's that
a shark
that's right he has such big teeth
while they searched Flounder began to get nervous
what was that he asked did you hear something
suddenly a very large shark smashed through the side of the ship
swim a shark Flounder cried
they swam away very quickly
Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them
you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
even though he was a very small fish Flounder had a very big
heart
and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert
