you wanna start with Sleeping Beauty or you wanna djou wanna start in the beginning
because Snow White is at the beginning I think
okay
alrighty
right
alright Snow White
Snow White is so sweet and gentle she makes lots of friends wherever she goes
she is always cheerful and looks on the bright side
she is romantic and longs to meet her true love
she is also very practical and works very hard
that's important mhm
you ate all the Pez
mhm
the purple Pez you can have after lunch
mhm
yes
oh you can't have lunch okay well then if you can't have lunch then you can't have Pez
okay should we read about Snow White
with hair as black as ebony and lips as red as roses and skin as white as snow this lovely princess is perfectly named Snow White
not only is she beautiful but she is sweet natured too
everyone loves her except of course her vain and jealous stepmother the queen
her favorite things include singing and dancing which always cheer her up and give her courage when she's afraid
telling stories is one of Snow White's great talents the seven dwarfs like to listen to her stories about the day her prince will come and how they'll live in a beautiful castle
the animals and birds of the forest love Snow White's kind and gentle nature
they even helped her clean up the dwarves' messy cottage
Snow White loves to walk in the enchanted forest and pick pretty flowers
but she can't things into the too many flowers into the cottage because flowers make Sneezy sneeze
when dwarfs when the dwarfs find out that Snow White is a good cook they are delighted even more so when they discover she can bake their favorite gooseberry pie
yeah
Snow White's world Snow White lives in an enchanted land with seven jeweled hills and seven waterfalls
beyond the farthest hill stands the castle where she grew up with her wicked stepmother
mhm
right it's true
Snow White has nowhere to go and gets lost in the dense forest
eventually she can run no farther and she falls to the ground in tears oh
the seven hills really are jeweled because there are dazzling diamonds inside
the seven dwarfs love to dig dig dig all day long in the diamond mines
oh my goodness
so this is where Snow White grew up
and this is where the dwarfs live
and that's the prince's castle
and those are the diamond mines
and the waterfalls
mhm
well this is when Snow White is ah lost in the dark forest
right
right
right she got lost but the nice animals helped her out right
and they took her to the seven dwarves' cottage
right
one of the great gifts that Snow White has is the ability to make friends easily
the animals and dwarfs would do anything for her even Grumpy
but the queen is madly jealous of her naturally beautiful stepdaughter and the cruel queen is a very dangerous enemy to have
as well as being Snow White's stepmother
mhm
right it says here as well as being Snow White's stepmother the queen is also a wicked witch
she does not like Snow White and she uses a poison apple to try and get rid of her
my goodness
that's not nice at all
no no no
mhm
right it's true there is the poison apple
right
right
no no
the seven dwarfs and the birds and animals that meet Snow White love her dearly
they try to protect her from the wicked queen and her spells
although the huntsman is a loyal servant of the queen
that's Grumpy Dock Bashful Sneezy Happy Dopey and Sleepy
he is always so sleepy isn't he
there's Sneezy
choo
that's right he's always sneezing
that's right
here's the huntsman he's a loyal servant of the queen but he is not wicked
seeing Snow White's sweet nature he cannot bear to carry out the queen's orders and hurt the princess
well but he decides he cannot hurt Snow White
he doesn't want to hurt her so he lets her go
right
no it's not nice that he promised to do it in the first place right
you're so soft
yes
that's the queen's castle
where Snow White grew up
mm
not so good
nope nope nope nope
from the moment that Snow White becomes more beautiful than the queen her life is in danger
although the seven dwarfs tried their best they cannot protect her from the queen's black magic
but good is stronger than evil
and in the end the prince's love for Snow White saves the day
well at first he thinks he's going to hurt Snow White
but then he changes his mind he can't bring himself to harm her
and he tells Snow White to run away from the queen
yeah
mhm
right
disguised as an old peddler woman the queen persuades trusting Snow White to take a bite of the poisoned apple
she promises it will make her dream come true
yes
right
as soon as Snow White takes a bite of the apple she falls to the ground in a deep sleep and cannot be woken
when the dwarves find her they place her in a special glass coffin
yes
she is very very mean you're right
mhm
but the dwarfs and Snow White
right
but Snow White and the dwarfs and the prince are all very nice aren't they
yeah
you're so right
she is not nice at all
no no no no no
he does not look so nice there either you're right
Cinderella
about Cinderella she is cheerful and sunny no matter how difficult things are
she is hard working and practical and she can cook and sew
she's very caring and heart is full of kindness
that's nice
poor Cinderella is made to work as a servant by her cruel stepmother and her spoiled stepsisters
but she never stops hoping and believing that one day her life will change
although they are only tiny mice Gus and Jack are Cinderella's loyal friends
they help her with her chores and save her from being lonely mhm
right
right that's right
you are so right my sweet
you are so right
okay
the fairy godmother makes Cinderella's dreams of happiness come true
her
mhm
mm
you're right
with blue beads
right
oh
what am I listening to
really
I'm listening to the nickel
really
oh I see
oh the chain of life will be broken
wow
let's see
Cinderella has no money to spend on clothes so her animal friends help her to patch up a simple dress an apron each morning and shine her worn out shoes
the birds and mice sew frills and bows on an old dress that once belonged to her mother so that Cinderella can go to the ball
uhhuh
well we don't get to meet her mother
yeah
well Cinderella was with her mother when she was younger
right
that's right hello belly girl
once upon a time the manor house was the happiest place in the whole kingdom
but when Cinderella's mean stepmother arrived things changed
Lady Chrimain made Cinderella sleep in the attic and do chores all day
Lady Chrimain is her stepmother
Anastasia and Drizella
oh my goodness gracious
oh no
right right
right
right
no
this is the kitchen where Cinderella spends much of her day cooking and cleaning
every morning Cinderella feeds the animals before she takes breakfast to her stepmother in bed
mhm
yes
right
right
right
mhm
right
yes that was good
a little magic is all Cinderella needs to find happiness
she has charm and beauty and all the elegance of a princess
and with a little help from her fairy godmother her dreams come true
to celebrate the prince's return all eligible ladies in the land are invited to attend a ball at the castle
well they are so jealous of Cinderella that they tear her outfit to pieces
oh no
but with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother ensures that Cinderella can go to the ball
mhm
oh no
as soon as their eyes meet at the ball Cinderella and the prince fall in love
but when the clock strikes mid midnight Cinderella leaves her glass slipper behind on the stairs in a hurry to leave before the magic ends
soon her dress
right
but she leaves it there
and the grand duke is absolutely delighted when Cinderella produces the matching glass slipper and puts it on her dainty foot
right
that's true
after all his searching Prince Charming has at last found the beautiful girl he danced with at the ball and the whole kingdom rejoices when he marries Cinderella
hooray
hooray
oh
about Aurora she is gentle and sweet natured
all who know her love her
right
she is thoughtful and unspoiled and always willing to help
she is a romantic and believes her dreams of love will one day come true

mm I don't know does she like to sing about the trees and the flowers
brought up in the countryside this sweet and
this sweet and gentle girl has no idea she's really a princess named Aurora
she learns the truth on her sixteenth birthday
the same day that due to a wicked curse put on her by a wicked fairy she falls into an enchanted sleep
mhm
well the wicked fairy is Malificent
oh no
oh no not again
oh boy
the good fairies take Aurora to live in a pretty little cottage deep in the forest to hide her from the wicked fairies' curse
they rename her oh my gosh

that's right she helps her aunts to dust and clean their cottage
Flora Fauna and Merryweather love Briar Rose dearly and have special plans for her birthday

Malificent is very offended when she is not invited to the royal party
and she is so angry that she curses baby Aurora
right
Malificent's curse comes true when Aurora pricks her finger on a spinning wheel and falls into a deep sleep
well no she doesn't die she just falls asleep
hm
when Prince Phillip tries to save Aurora Malificent turns into a fierce dragon
but with the sword of truth and the shield of virtue he defeats her
wow
a little rose
as far as Aurora is concerned her life has been uneventful
for sixteen years she has lived in the forest longing for excitement and romance
with no other friends besides the woodland animals
but then on her sixteenth birthday everything seems to happen at once
yes
oh no
no that Malificent is mean
oh no
when the fairies find Aurora asleep they know that king and queen will be heartbroken

even if it means swimming into dangerous shark infested waters Ariel cannot resist the temptation to explore the ocean for shipwrecks so she can add to her amazing collection of human things
