okay you hold your box
got it
okay
got it
so many things to do
you're a busy busy girl
wow
oh oh
okay
okay
who's that
Cinderella
every day Cinderella woke up early to do chores for her stepmother and stepsisters
from morning to night she they gave her things to do
but the birds and mice were Cinderella's friends and helped her with her work
one morning a messenger came from the palace to invite Cinderella and her stepsisters to a royal ball
oh a little bird wearing a pink hat
wow
yellow hat
and a green hat too
Cinderella was very excited but her stepmother gave her a long list of chores to do before she could go
while Cinderella was busy working the birds and mice began fixing an old dress that had belonged to Cinderella's mother
before long they made Cinderella a beautiful gown
by the time Cinderella finished her chores she thought it was too late to get ready for the ball
and was very sad
surprise the birds and mice gave Cinderella the finished gown
oh thank you so much she said
Cinderella got dressed and rushed to join her stepsisters but when they saw her they became so jealous they tore her lovely gown to pieces
oh no they tore her gown
that wasn't very nice
Cinderella ran to the garden and wept
just then sparkling lights swirled all around
it was her
who was it
who is that
it's her fairy godmother
dry those tears she said you can't go to the ball looking like that
with a wave of her magic wand the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and Cinderella's rags into a gorgeous gown
and with one more wave Cinderella had tiny glass slippers on her feet
before Cinderella left for the ball she received a warning
on the stroke of midnight the spell will be broken and everything will be as before
that night at the ball the prince met Cinderella and without knowing each other's names they danced and danced until the clock struck midnight
I must go Cinderella cried
and as she fled she lost a
a glass slipper on the staircase
the next day the prince announced he wanted to marry the girl who had lost her glass slipper
when the wicked stepmother realized it was Cinderella who was the prince's favorite she locked Cinderella in her room
let me out Cinderella cried
the grand duke went to every home in the kingdom looking for the maiden whose foot fit the tiny glass shoe
Cinderella's little friends took the key out of the stepmother's pocket and slipped it under Cinderella's door just in time
when the grand duke put the slipper on Cinderella's foot
it fit perfectly
soon after Cinderella and the prince were married and they lived happily ever after
that one oh look who that is
that's Snow white
oh yes
long ago there lived a lovely princess named Snow white
oh she's wearing a blue bow in her hair
Snow white's stepmother the queen was jealous of Snow white's beauty
each day the queen would ask magic mirror on the wall who's the fairest one of all
and the mirror would always answer you are
one day the mirror said a lovely maid I see who is more fair than thee
the queen knew it must be Snow white
Snow white was so beautiful and kind that even a handsome prince who was passing by soon noticed her
little did he know that when he came into the courtyard to sing to Snow white the evil queen was watching nearby
the queen was very jealous
ooh now she's wearing a red bow you're right
Snow white realized she must leave home or risk being hurt by the queen
Snow white was so frightened that she ran deep into the forest
do you know where I can stay she asked a group of friendly animals
what kind of animals are there
some bunny rabbits and
a turtle
that's right and you know what this is
a raccoon and you know what these are
those are little deer
and that's a little chipmunk
right
chipmunks
and a squirrel and oh
mushrooms wow
look it looks like a reindeer that's right
oh it is a reindeer okay
I think it might be yes
yes I think so
I think you're right
the animals led Snow white to a tiny cottage in the woods
it's like a doll's house she said
she knocked on the door but no one answered
so she slowly stepped inside
Snow white found seven tiny bowls seven tiny chairs and seven tiny beds
but the cottage was a mess
oh my there must be seven tiny children living here
let's clean the house and surprise them she said to the animals
and then maybe they'll let me stay
soon seven tiny men arrived the seven dwarves
Snow white promised to wash and sew and sweep for the little men
in return they kept her safe and happy
the seven dwarfs loved having Snow white stay in their cottage
back at the castle the magic mirror told the queen where Snow white was hiding
the queen was so angry that she drank a potion and turned herself into an old hag
and then she created a magic apple
with one bite of this poisoned apple Snow white's eyes will close forever
the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss
as soon as the dwarves went to work the queen disguised as a peddler woman approached Snow white
the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarves
but by the time the dwarves arrived it was too late
Snow white had already taken a bite of the poisoned apple and
she took a bite of that apple and she fell asleep
oh my
the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarves raced after her and chased her to a rocky cliff
well the the seven dwarves are angry at the witch because she's not very nice to Snow white
well the seven dwarves are nice they're just angry
a rock broke beneath her feet and the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below
