*MOT:	okay then that's it (be)cause these are long ones .
*MOT:	(o)kay ? 1044400_1046456
*MOT:	far away beyond the widest oceans lies the enchanted land of Feria . 1054503_1060375
*MOT:	the people of Feria are always happy for the summers are long the falls are beautiful the springs are a joy and the winters although a little cold are short . 1060376_1068720
*MOT:	it is such a beautiful place and the crops grow so well that there is little for the Ferian people to do but enjoy themselves in the sun . 1068720_1074986
*MOT:	so they rarely work and instead spend their days playing having parties making music and telling each other wonderful stories . 1074986_1081506
*MOT:	hey I wanna go there do you ? 1081506_1083330
*MOT:	mhm . 1085656_1086945
*MOT:	some people might say that they are lazy but they wouldn't care because they're just so happy . 1086945_1090861
*MOT:	but one year it wasn't like that . 1090863_1092635
*MOT:	that year in fact the people of Feria were far from happy indeed they were very worried . 1092635_1096796
*MOT:	for although spring should have arrived weeks before it hadn't none of the winter snows were gone yet . 1096796_1102615
*MOT:	and lakes had not thawed the birds were not building their nests and the buds of the flowers in the mountain meadows had had failed to open . 1102616_1109066
*MOT:	not good enough said the king something must be done . 1109066_1112705
*MOT:	which one you think's [: think is] the king Vi(olet) ? 1112705_1114936
*MOT:	let Violet choose please Maxwell . 1114936_1117275
*MOT:	which one do you think Vi(olet) ? 1117275_1119263
*MOT:	the same as he said ? 1119263_1121971
*MOT:	I was gonna guess that guy . 1124036_1127025
*MOT:	(be)cause you know why ? 1127025_1129276
*MOT:	he looks older and he was the one talking but then when Max pointed to that one I think he's right because that one has the crown on . 1130141_1136105
*MOT:	right ? 1136105_1137628
*MOT:	but it's funny the king's [: king is] usually old isn't he ? 1137628_1140555
*MOT:	all the men and women of great council except for one shook their heads for they did not know the answer but the oldest and wisest member stood up .
*MOT:	it is because the spring unicorn the bringer of spring has not visited Feria this year he explained without his arrival there can be no spring . 1149208_1156911
*MOT:	the king and the other members of the council looked at each other and frowned but why has the spring unicorn not come to Feria asked the king . 1156913_1163485
*MOT:	doesn't he like us anymore ? 1163485_1165240
*MOT:	I think it could be because we are so busy enjoying ourselves that we never thank the spring unicorn for all he does for us it could be that he thinks we are lazy and don't deserve to live in such a wonderful place suggested the wisest council member . 1165240_1177591
*MOT:	but we must pay that put that right at once said the king all the people in the land must leave the warmth of their homes and go out and start work immediately . 1177593_1185273
*MOT:	they must start &-um they must &-um . 1185273_1189045
*MOT:	the king wanted to describe the sorts of things that people should be doing when they went out to work but the trouble was he knew nothing about work so he didn't know what to say . 1189045_1196525
*MOT:	finally he said they &-er they must you know they must bustle about being busy doing work and things . 1196525_1203281
*MOT:	do you know what a work thing is Violet ? 1203283_1205706
