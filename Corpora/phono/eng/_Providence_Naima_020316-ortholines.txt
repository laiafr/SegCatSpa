but I m gonna slice it and I m gonna try it and then I will tell you if it s
okay to eat
cause it needs to be ripe
before you can eat it needs to be ripe
because eating things that aren t ripe
will sometimes make you sick

oh it s going to be so delicious
it s going to be so scrumptious

how s the kiwi do you like it

that was
let s see that was not last night that was the night before last
that s where I was
I had to talk about what kind of food we re going to order
what kind of food we want the truck to bring
that s what I was doing
well because
the co op is a group of people who have to pick out things and have to decide things
and talk about the reasons we re gonna do things one way or the other
that s kinda what a meeting is usually
the food co op yeah
you know who else was at that meeting

well I think you didn t realize that you needed to poop
page seventy two is completely missing

well we do wanna let them go outside
well they belong outside they don t really belong in the house
sometimes they come in the house by accident
and sometimes they come maybe because they smell food and the door s left open just a crack
just like in the cat book
yeah
people sometimes leave doors open by accident and then cats can get out
flies can get in mosquitoes can get in
let s get this bit of green food off your nose there

what were you spelling with a b
brocco hummus
actually b is the first letter in brocco hummus
it makes the sound
that s just the sound that letter b makes
yep I m right here
yep I don t see the fly where is it
I m not seeing the fly
you worried about the fly
you don t really need to be worried about the fly flies don t really bite
most of the flies that come in the house anyway they re not the kind that bite
yessie
okay
okay
nice you wanna drink some water
Daddy s gonna get you some water I think
little cups
you can use this one
it s a big cup
that it s kinda old
Sleepy Bear s got his
booties on
you wanna come look at books with Mommy now
on the bed
oh you want fresh air you know the other the windows are also open
I think there s plenty of fresh air in this room cause both windows are open
are you recording
yes I am
there s some food that still needs to get stuck in the fridge in the kitchen
okay
that s all that needs to happen
you wanna read
go down and make my phone call
but I have two to make
yeah that s fine that s fine
you wanna read Snow Day with me
okay
a bocka bocka bocka
are you being a chicken
a chicken who says bocka bocka bocka bocka bocka
let s read Snow Day and then
then we ll go get jama for you
cause you you need a pajama top
and then
after you get your pajama top on
Mommy will brush Mommy s teeth
Daddy did a good job didn t he
you started to do the zipper
which zipper
does the big pillow have a zipper
oh I guess I didn t know that you can show me afterwards
yes I am
what s going on in this picture
there s a snow storm happening
take your hand off the microphone though
there s a snowstorm happening
cause there s snow coming out of the sky out of the clouds
mm weather watchers had been predicting a big snow storm for days
what kind of a truck is that
that is a snowplow
it s doing what to the snow
what did you say it was doing
factoring the snow
it s pushing the snow
those that part of the snowplow pushes the snow
mm so that the cars can drive you re right
cars can t drive through this kind of snow
so the plow is taking the snow out of the streets
even before the snow stopped falling town work crews were out with their trucks to begin a long hard job of digging out
mm
oh we skipped a page
look at all the houses and buildings and schools and there s a church
they re all covered with snow
all the buildings and look I think that s a snowplow over there
it is
and do you know what these are
these are electric wires
they re carrying electricity from
building from one building to another
or maybe those are telephone wires actually
hm those might be electric and telephone wires
the wire that you saw at Craigville beach with Daddy and the ducks that you saw on the way
you remembering seeing those things
you saw a wire in the sand huh
did Daddy say it was he thought it was for a phone that they used to have in the lifeguard s chair
I think that s what you told me that he said it was
remember we saw a lifeguard today at Douse s beach
she was wearing red pants
and a red swim suit
she was a lifeguard
lifeguards sometimes wear red
yes they do they like to go in the water with swimsuits
well lifeguards are there in case anybody has trouble in the water and they need help
lifeguards are there to go and and give them help if they need help in the water
because if you don t know how to swim sometimes you can have
difficulty in the water swimming
and you need some help you need someone to help carry you
but you re not gonna have that problem cause you ll learn how to swim
there s the plow again I see it
it s orange
I also see a whole lot of school buses covered with snow
dyou see them
right there
all the school buses are covered with snow and they re not taking the children to school
because there s too much snow
yeah
that
mhm
that boy is holding a teddy bear
that s a family who is waking up and looking out at the snow
and finding out that it s a snow day
oh boy everybody s having fun here what s everybody doing
you tell me what do you see
she is
about to throw a snowball at
that kid
and that kid is throwing a snowball way over there
they re having a snowball fight
that means you make balls out of the snow and you throw them
snowball fight
that s a game it s kind of a game that kids play
big kids play
cause it s fun to make the snowballs and then they throw them at each other and they go phwack
phwack
thwack
oh the dinosaur the dinosaur s tail sounds like thwack you remember that
yeah
oh did that hurt
I see some kids building a snow man
the kid in the red jacket is making a snow man
that s a huge snowball I think
that maybe they are building a an igloo
out of snow
or a snow fort
I think that s she s carrying some snow to build a wall there
it s fun to build things with snow
it s just a fun thing to do that s all
and I see a lot of kids who are sliding on sleds down the hill
in this picture
that sled is being pulled by a mommy
mhm
oh they re going to see Tahoe on the way home
I think you re remembering when it was winter and Mommy pulled you and the sled up the driveway and you saw Tahoe
was she barking
yeah
she was a young dog then
dyou know that bird sound right now
those are morning doves
listen again
yep
they ll probably make another noise in just a minute
there
that hoo oo hoo hoo
those are morning doves
yeah
we ll probably hear it again
let s listen
hey Mommy
oops

make a noise in just a second
yes
I guess the morning dove decided not to talk
she s being quiet
Daddy s downstairs making some phone calls

I guess the morning dove went to sleep
cause it s nighttime and it s bedtime
let s get up cause I m gonna
