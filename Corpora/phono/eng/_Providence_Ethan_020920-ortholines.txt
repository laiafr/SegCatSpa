Turbo says
can you show me how to do the loop de loop
mhm
shoop
zhoo did I do it right
whoop
okay Harold will show him
all you have to do is put your nose down in the air
down toward the ground
and concentrate and then flip a little
he says it's kind of like a somersault in the air
now can you do it Turbo says Harold
you copy me
ready
we'll do it at the same time
zhoop
they both did loop de loops
he has no wings that's right
we don't have any other planes with wings I don't think
yeah
and propellers
these are little mini propellers on the tips of his wings
yep
that's right
did he land in the pond
ha ha ha
he is on his own dock
good thing Harold
now where does this guy land
maybe he hasta land at the airport
okay good now they can rest in their sheds for the night
you know what sheds are called for airplanes
airplanes go to sleep in places called hangars
he
they need their hangars
zhoo
there we can pretend this box is their hangar
oh you're gonna put them way in
uhoh
is he making noise
is the awake one making noise
keeping the other one from sleeping
shh Turbo be quiet
Harold is trying to sleep
we could sing him a lullaby
hello bonjour
whoops
hola hello
that's gonna wake him up
hola let's play a game
can you sing him twinkle twinkle little star
Brasilia is the capital
okay shush
can you sing him twinkle little star now so he can go to sleep
twinkle
up
above
the world
like a
in the
twinkle
little
how I
wonder what you are
you eating your turtleneck now
belly there
whoa
he is way down there though
hm how about an angel or a giraffe
we need a giraffe to watch over them
because giraffes have long necks
he could hang up right here
oops
who can read them a story that's a good question
who do you want to read
you want me to read them a story
yep you wanna pick a story for them
see what kind of story they might like to listen to
mkay that's a good sleeping story except it doesn't make any sense
because the pages are out of order
I'm just gonna read it the way it is okay
yeah they're in the wrong order
one day in Teletubby land all the Teletubbies were feeling very very tired
can you yawn
so they decided to go to bed
ooh bed
oop they're starting to fall asleep Ethan shh
go to sleep Teletubbies go to sleep
go to sleep Teletubbies go to sleep
all the Teletubbies are asleep
but where is
who's missing
Po
Po is riding her scooter
scooter
and then it says Dipsy is supposed to be in bed
that doesn't make any sense because this was about Po
so this is the wrong page
that's better
go to sleep Teletubbies go to sleep
oh sweetie
you're gonna ruin your shirt
you already ruined it
yep
same
ahhah
that's a shape where nobody has been
let's see what happens next
Tinky Winky is supposed to
is
has gone for a walk with her
what
yep her bag
they're both what
they are both Teletubbies
La La is supposed to be in bed
oop you attaching the giraffe to the thing
open the legs a little
you got it
now it's yeah now we should put one on this side
you see that they have their tongues sticking out a little bit
giraffes have very long tongues
longer than yours
longer than mine
mhm they're looking at each other
they're seeing whose tongue is longer
my tongue is longer
no my tongue is longer
no my tongue is longer
no my tongue is longer
oh please don't eat your shirt
yes they do
yeah it's narrow but now it's
mhm
on the corner
will it stay yeah it does stay
probably the
Turbo
mhm he's flying between the two giraffes
the space is wide enough
if it was narrow
then he might not be able to fly between them huh
he can fly under yep
he flew between them
that's a good trick Turbo
mm
yep
whoops Mr Potato Head opened up here
you wanna make something
you wanna build with blocks
wanna play with play dough
or clay
or do a finger paint
wanna do a finger paint
yeah he has a different kind of hands than the other guy
I think that's so he can hold onto scoop
little little scoop in here
the little scoop
maybe
this bucket moves doesn't it
whoops
no
the big scoop is downstairs
I don't think it's in there sweetie I saw it downstairs
you're right it is a part of a d
it's the inside part of the d
and dropped him down he was hanging on your finger
you're sliding under the train table
you are slip sliding away
what else is in there
look at all the things on top of it for fighting fires
you know what a lot of these are
a shovel and a pick axe
that's a twirly thing
you can make it for Teletubby land
because it looks a little bit like a pin wheel doesn't it
let's stack it on top yeah and make it twirl
zhuh
uhhuh
you have
you know you have a pin wheel in this room I think
we have a real pin wheel I think
do we still have a pin wheel
so let's see your pin wheel
we had one and it broke but I thought we had another one
here's some good paper
do you wanna do a finger painting
somebody just sneezed
who sneezed
I remember Ethan
yes I remember that you sneeze like that
remember that I sneeze like that
yeah
yeah achoo
that was funny
here ya wanna finger paint
you told me you wanted to finger paint this morning
yeah you could put this to hold the paper down
like that
wanna build something
Mr Potato Head be quiet
the racing car parts
that's right
and what about this one
very good
i think it goes closer
it can go closer
like that
I knew you were gonna say that
so I had the guy ready
yep he is
he's driving it fast
careful you're gonna bump into the tripod
you bumped right into the easel
that's your board for playing with your
spaceship guys
ya gonna play with your spaceship guys
here we'll put it right on top here
hm what's that
some craters right
to be on the planet I'm gonna take this Mr Potato Head guy outta here
now what else do you wanna put on there
you wanna put some aliens on that planet
popping out of the craters
like in astronaut piggy wiggy
there's an alien huh
how can you make Mr Potato Head be quiet
do you know how to make
oh sweetie
you're gonna really ruin that sweater
achoo
where's his spaceship
where is his spaceship huh
that's a good place to put the spaceship yeah
mhm
mm put it right on top that's nice
fire
where is the fire
there's some fire
be careful it's hot
I'm play pretending
it's not really hot
that's great
underneath the spaceship yeah
I'm gonna get you a new shirt
be right back
okay
space
you landed on the planet
well that's good
I think when it lands the fire goes away
the fire goes out
it only needs the fire just to take off
I'm gonna take your sweater off
that's right
he landed right on this mysterious red planet
mhm
you oops
there ya go
mm
he's landing landing landing
he landed too
you know what we have to do
the space man from the rocket ship hasta meet
the astronaut from the rocket ship hasta meet the alien from his rocket ship
right and they each have
they each have their own spaceships
you want me to get you one of the astronauts
oh right because there's no gravity in space
he's floating
we need a piece of string to tie him to his spaceship don't we
mm let's find a piece of string
mhm here we we have a piece of string right here
this might help
okay
it's very long yeah
you want me to help you
maybe you could loop it through the loop here
a couple of times like this
and then
yeah put it through
that keeps it on the spaceship and then we hafta attach it
to the alien right
should we tie it around his arm
yeah
you wanna do something else
so now he's attached
oh that guy
right this is just the alien
there we go we'll attach it to his maybe his neck
around his space helmet
that's right
he can make some repairs to his spaceship right
mm yeah
now he can hang out in space
yep he's floating away up in the air too but we know he can always come back
because he's tied on to his spaceship
mm
yep
but he will never fly all too far because he's attached
so he is floating up woo this is fun zero gravity is fun
can he do high moon jumps
his moon mobile ooh we don't
we don't have a moon mobile do we
here
first he hasta come down closer to his space ship
so he doesn't float away in the we
on the
we take off the
string
there don't float away
whoa he was almost floating away
get into your space ship or moon mobile quickly
we don't really have a moon mobile do we
what can we use for a moon mobile
the spaceship could float away too I guess in zero gravity
uhoh it floated up and went bonk right into a planet
bonk
it might need some repairs here
mhm
oops
there we go
yep
that's where he belongs
yep
he has a space helmet just like these guys do
that one looks a little big for him huh
but here's a naked astronaut
I mean she's in her bathing suit
she might need a uniform soon
and where's the guy
I don't see the guy
there's the girl
a gal
yeah
this is funny the guy seems to be missing
yup
heh that's pretty smart
you've got the earth and earth moon
earth moon earth moon earth moon
that was a good idea sweetie
mhm
you found his bottom
mhm
the squigglies yeah
I wonder why they make them in two pieces instead of a whole one
a whole alien
that's so they can come out of the craters
yeah a lot of the aliens are green aren't they
ahhah
yeah they're almost exactly the same
they're the same size they have the same uniform but it's just a different color
they have their moon
do they have their moon boots on
yep silver moon boots
you did hook them together
it makes one fat spaceman
I don't know what it makes
a thick one
mhm
there ya go
well here's one guy
the other one might have fallen out let's see
if we can see it anywhere around here
nope so it might be in the basket over here
because that's where the box was
oops
yeah that's a toolbox
here's another tool that belongs in there
and here's another tool that belongs in there
a lot of the tools didn't make it in there
and here's a tool bench
mm
what kind of tools do you have
mhm
that's a good question
is the hammer here
hope
ooh
hm mm
there's the axe
yeah we glued it on but I guess it didn't work very well
yeah the glue didn't stay very well
the right one
you chopping why don't you chop the tree down
whoops
yes you're a lumberjack
chopping down the tree
that's right
to make it into lumber
well ya know
where's the log
cause when you cut down a tree then you get logs and we have a log on your train table somewhere
so you cut down your tree and a log falls off
you've got yourself a log now load it into the log car
can I reach it
I reached it
here ya go lumberjack
good work
yup
mhm
now it can go off to the sawmill
ah where do you think the sawmill is
let's make a sawmill
make a building that can be the sawmill
we're gonna build a sawmill here
blocks of the same color
we'll build a sawmill like that
mhm
we can make a house or I was pretending to make a sawmill
there
maybe they made that house out of the wood that you cut down
mm all these blocks are made outta wood
do you know what building that is
can
can you tell what building that is
what's in front
a dalmatian yeah
so what kind of building should
is it
a fire station right
yeah in the firehouse
and we even have a
fire truck that belongs to the set
there it is
woo whoops
yep
and if the doors could open it would go right inside
I'm gonna pretend only they don't really open yep
you open the doors
you would also this
this has set has a
do you know what that place is
it has the red crosses on it
yeah it's a hospital
so we must have an ambulance in here somewhere there it is
so the ambulance usually goes to the fire with the firefighters they drive together
mhm
and they both have sirens don't they
the siren is kinda yellow
yeah the light at the top is kinda yellow
that one doesn't have one does it
usually it's a red on an ambulance
you have another ambulance up on top
donchoo
where's that ambulance
the island of Sodor ambulance
mm is it there
it's inside the hospital
we have to do that trick to open it up remember it's a little broken
oop
yes
you're right
yep
and there red siren and a red light on top
you want you wanna make it stick inside
I'll push in your direction and maybe you can stick it inside yourself
can you reach
yes you can
whoops
there ya go
side
oh Harold
oop Harold lands on top
it's hard for you to reach huh
should we make the road shorter
oh you can come around the table
zhoog zhoo circling
shh he lands
it's a little broken
I don't know if we can
we hafta try to see if we can fix it somehow
Harold doesn't open the doors anymore
yeah if the hospital is broken
Harold works just fine
but the doors to the hospital are broken
I don't know what happened
I think we closed it shut tight too many times
should we look inside
there's a mechanism inside
a mechanism inside that makes it open
let's see if we can see how it works
maybe we could fix it
a mechanism we might need your tools
I see
you closed the doors
I was trying to fix it
maybe your axe
your axe could work too
oh you wanna
whoops
this is how I would try to open
I would use
sometimes you use axes to pry things open
you wanna pry it open
you'd rather chop the door open
let's pry it together okay
well done
oop you pried the other side open
that was good
yep
that's right that's what happens when somebody's sick
the ambulance comes and takes them away
ahhah
whoops your hand stuck in there
mhm
are they feeling better now
did they go to the hospital and now they feel better
you think or are they still sick and they hafta go back to the hospital
around the corner
he's taking a long drive
there's the guy
around the corner
should I make the sound still
that's a submarine alright
okay we can make the submarine
let's
mkay we got everything right here in this box
need to take your racing car apart
the racing car is right over there
let's see let's see
I need to look at the pictures
where's the submarine
submarine
okay so it has
that front
mhm
mm that's good
I think it goes further up
yeah
mm
there ya go
maybe even further up
huh interesting
maybe the front is this way
that's the way it goes no
that's the way it goes I think
then you need the tail part
is it
yeah
it is
it's the same as the picture
I'm confused
it has another part
a little part this part
that's why I was confused
now that goes
ahhah
maybe we did it wrong
let's see if we can figure this out
I always forget
okay so this is the back
we did it wrong
so this goes
there
now we
can you put the front on
that how it looks
I think they
this hasta go over the wheel
like that
goes on top
mhm perfect
and what goes inside the hole up here

there you go whoops
that's right
and you know what else it has on it
it has a helicopter
I mean a propeller

you know why the go under water Ethan
to look at fish
they go under water to look at all the fish that live deep down in the deep blue sea
mhm
the ocean has a floor right
the ocean has a bottom so they can drive along the ocean floor maybe
yep
we all live in a yellow submarine
a yellow submarine
yeah it is a yellow submarine that's why I was singing the song
it works perfectly
we all live in a
yellow submarine
yeah
and you can live in a submarine see these things
these are windows and I bet when the driver is done driving he goes inside the submarine and takes a nap
I bet there's a bed inside
he can't really go inside
yeah I think he is
mm
mhm
yeah then he drives it takes a nap drives it takes a nap
now we need a fish
