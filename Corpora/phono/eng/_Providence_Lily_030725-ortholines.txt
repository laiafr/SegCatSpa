is it all set or
it should be yeah
yeah that would help finally
Lily say something
yeah well that's what happens when you put put mushrooms and leaves in right
and little ants
sure
is it low enough down do you think
yes Angel
whoa
that's some good galloping Honey
right
that's good
so do you wanna be black or red
black okay
okay
I think maybe you're gonna to run out first this time
I'm gonna wait for you to put some in too
then I won't have any left
that's right
that's my last piece
oops
you got that extra piece
yeah two more
huh
huh
oh I don't think they're gonna be two extras
well because there aren't enough pieces
there are lots of pieces but there's only one extra piece
there used to be two but remember we lost one so now there's only one extra
do you wanna play dominoes instead
that's a flag like on a castle
how's that
yes
what
right
thanks
now I have the extra
alright
right
okay
thanks
all set
yes
you are
bye bye
where you going
oh
yeah what do you think of this crab
right
except he has short arms
yes
yes
one blue and one
he needs an orange
oh well I built his head like that which has the orange one
should I change that
okay
well he doesn't always have to look like he looks in the book
you know but we can change that
see the problem is we're missing one of these white ones
oh I see how they did it okay
so his his arms are gonna be a little short okay
and we're missing an orange piece too
so we don't have that last orange piece
so we have to build it with some different pieces
yes
yes Honey
gonna gonna make something cool
alright
wow what do you have there
you sure like making that sword
are you gonna go slay a dragon with that sword
heh you
huh
whoa
oh goodness alright
oh the fireball is coming
yes
oh yeah there's another orange piece
that's right
you know we're still missing that this one of those white ones though
so if you see one of these white ones around
we should put it back in the box
but we can still make a lot of other things without it
I don't know maybe it's upstairs
but we'll look for it later
well maybe it's under
maybe it's under the table
you see it
no
okay
that's alright we can build lots of things without it
like we can build this
we can build this fish
this guy
sort of a a fish and a crab
yeah
yes
you did you found that little missing piece
now it's one on one foot
wow
yeah
I don't know
I just threw some pieces together
it's right there
your welcome
sure
okay
maybe I
yeah yeah
huh
well we could take a piece off of him
off of this guy
if you want
the squiggly thing
this one
okay but if we put that in then we can't attach
yeah there's no place for the
but we can take one of these blue ones
put that in there
whoa
I see
I think that's pretty neat
well
maybe it's a swordfish
because this kind of looks like a sword
the bottom part
this is a funny looking swordfish
what do you think
a sword dolphin
you wanna make him even taller
here let's try this
we can put
well we can put some more legs on him
so he's nice and stable
thanks
then we can
put some more
pegs to make him taller
even taller
yeah that's a tough one to get out
sure
I'll help you
you know what the best way to do it is
put your fingers like this
you hold it like this
and
push
push it out like this
oh sorry
okay
yeah that's pretty hard
yeah Mom will get it
whoa
alright
yeah that's right
oh
yeah it does
whoa
tip it over
sure okay
yeah maybe we should put the red part down below
that'll make it more stable
okay let's try that
the red one here
we'll do it from
biggest to smallest okay
so we get the red one now we're gonna have the yellow one
and
the blue ones come next
because they're the next biggest
then we'll have the orange ones
I'll have all the orange ones
is that alright
well
well looks likes it's standing up pretty well
now do you want one eye or two eyes
two eyes
can you put that off
okay
alright
now we need to give this guy a name
is it boy or a girl
hm I think it it's a girl
tall
that's a good
that's a very good name
tallest
you know what
we've got another little
another little peg
but I think we're out of
little platforms
but let's see we could probably put a fin on there if we wanted
okay
that's perfect
now we can put this fin on
alright
fin it is
right
we could do it too
well maybe there used to be a fin on the end here
here's one funny looking creature huh
yep
you wanna put eyes
yes okay
you know what I thought of something else too
we can make it even taller
do you wanna make it taller
well
maybe not
I think so I think she's talking on the telephone
I think we might need to wait just a little bit
no we have to wait
we have to wait until this is over Honey
then we'll take a bath right after that
okay
you want the eyes
okay
whoa
careful
try it again
put it right on the top
I'll hold it steady
just to put it in that little hole there
yep
there you go
finished alright
