right I mean
oh boy
oh boy oh boy
when we last saw him he was just a little slip of a thing
are you still nursing or did you great
huh
yeah
yeah
yes I do
yeah
huh
huh
yeah
yeah
yeah well I'm doing that and she's almost two so
yeah
yeah
well I would have liked to have waited but
I I wasn't gonna force the issue
huh
oh he
yeah she run well no but she runs that childrens' place
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm that's good yup
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm mhm
mhm
yeah yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
well it's partly
it's not completely good or bad it's partly about what your level of tolerance is I mean that that's part of the equation I mean
yeah sure
no I well
I don't I don't like I don't like it I wish it weren't happening but I'm also not willing to do what it takes
well I mean I am willing to do what it takes to reduce it but not to force it if you know what I mean
and and I think she
it is well I can go on and on on this topic it's like all I ever think about to be honest with you
but the
I mean no that's an exaggeration but
because sleep is important that's why
for all of us
she doesn't have a sleeping problem because she sleeps right
I mean she barely wakes up to nurse
so it's not a question about her not sleeping it's a question about me not sleeping
no what we did
is a couple of months well maybe like three or four months ago we got a single bed and put it next to our king sized bed in our bedroom
so she sleeps on that much of the night
and she
so she's farther away from me
and I either go down to her bed to nurse her
and and I try to just wait and see if she's really waking up to nurse or not
you know so
because sometimes she'll almost wake up but then she'll go back to sleep without being nursed
so it's also about listening carefully and waiting
but anyway sometimes I'll go down to her bed to nurse her and sometimes I'll bring her up to the bed and sometimes I'll have the energy to put her back on hers and other times she just stays in bed
I mean I'm not I I don't feel feel like I have an ideal situation
can I can I tell you about a book that I like though about this topic
Elizabeth Pantley is the author
it's called the no cry sleep solution
and she is someone who has worked with William Sears who writes all those children's books
and I I like her approach because she's kind of like she's kind of like
well it's hard to describe but you know middle of the
like if you need to sleep she's got suggestions on what you can do and yet she
recognizes there are lots of people like me at least who want like no crying
but want to sleep
so it's kinda like way
like possible ways of making that happen
and it didn't
I can't say that and it's also one of these things that's not a rigid plan it's more like an approach and suggestions and
stuff like that so it's not like you have to follow a plan
yeah oh I think she's got some really good ideas and
apparently I mean
and I was also on an an email group of people who are following her plan and there's like eight hundred people on the list
so I don't follow it I mean I kinda like I just kind of abandoned it for the time being but but I but I think a lot of people are actually having success with her method
and a lot of people aren't too I mean I'd say that it's like one of those things
so
Furbur yes
yeah yeah
yeah
and the yeah go back yeah yeah
yeah
right
yup yeah
mhm think of
think through what you might wanna do
mhm
mhm
yeah
yeah
yeah
and that's hard for him
yeah
yeah oh
oh I have
you know that's exactly what has happened to me
I just started at a certain point I started getting insomnia
like inability to go back to sleep
and that just completely complicates things
and I think it was around when she was age that that was happening to me too
I can jump to the punch line that one one of her major suggestions in that book is to
unlatch the baby when you're nursing
him to sleep
before so that he doesn't actually fall asleep with a nipple in his mouth
and she's just kind of suggests that you do that religiously and repeatedly
you know until he kinda unlearns that's the only way he can fall asleep
yeah
yeah well that's
she's not saying that to do that
yeah sure yeah yeah
