here s a cheetah
can you hear the crocodile
all
and all the monkeys
but sometime after midnight the elephant goes
and whoever has been sleeping hasn t
isn t sleeping anymore
and then there s a lullaby
that mommy s not too good at singing
let s read
you wanna read giraffes can t dance
you wanna read this one
or
you wanna read this one
or this one
okay
mkay
that s for William
no
they what
okay alright
that s fine we ll just leave it here
thought I would try
see look at
here s the dance giraffing making all these beautiful moves
Gerald was a tall giraffe whose neck was long and slim
but his knees were awfully crooked and his legs were rather thin
he was very good and standing still and munching shoots off trees
but when he tried to run around he buckled at the knees
now every year in Africa they hold the jungle dance
where every single animal turns up to skip and prance
and this year
oh and this year when the day arrived poor Gerald felt so sad
because it
when it came time to dance he was really very bad
the wart hog started waltzing and the rhinos rock and rolled
the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold
the chimps all did a chacha with a very latin
they re doing chacha that s right
and eight baboons then teamed up for a splendid Scottish
Gerald swallowed
okay alright alright
alright
yeah
yeah those are the chimps doing chacha see and here they are watching
Gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor but
no they re not doing dancing no they re watching
but the lion saw him coming and they soon began to roar
hey look at clumsy Gerald the animals all sneered
giraffes can t dance you silly fool oh Gerald you re so weird
Gerald simply froze up he was rooted to the spot
they re right he thought I m useless oh I feel like such a clod
so he crept off from the dance floor and he started walking home
he d never felt so sad before so sad and all alone
then he found a little clearing and he looked up at the sky
the moon can be so beautiful he whispered with a sigh
excuse me coughed a cricket who d seen Gerald earlier on
but sometimes when you re different you just need a different song
listen to the swaying grass and listen to the trees
to me the sweetest music is those branches in the breeze
so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you
that s Gerald the giraffe
everything makes music if you really want it to
yeah wow
that s what the cricket s telling him that if every
that if he listens to the music of his own song that he can
with that the cricket smiled and picked up
yeah what listen
the violin that s right
with that the cricket smiled and picked up his violin
then Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing
that s right
his hooves had started shuffling making circles on the ground
his neck was gently swaying and his tail was swishing around
he threw his arms out sideways and he swung them everywhere
then he did a backwards somersault and leapt up in the air
Gerald felt so wonderful his mouth was open wide
I m dancing yes I m dancing I m dancing Gerald cried
then one by one each animal who d been there at the dance
arrived while Gerald boogied on
and watched him quite entranced
they shouted it s a miracle we must be in a dream
yeah Gerald s the best dancer that we ve ever ever seen
how did you learn how to dance like that please Gerald tell us how
but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow
and he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above
we all can dance he said when we find music that we love
