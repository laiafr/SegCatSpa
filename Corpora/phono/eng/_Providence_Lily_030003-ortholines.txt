what city is this
where do the grandma and grandpas live
New York
it's New York City
first they get washed there are ninety two men and thirteen women
many take showers and a few take baths
two men and three women run bubble baths
and one man reads in the tub while a cat watches
one woman sits in the bubbles and sings
they're all getting clean right
he's taking a shower
scrubbing his feet
she's taking a shower
he's washing his hair
she's taking a bubble bath and singing
she has pink fuzzy slippers huh
yeah
she likes to go to bed with her pink fuzzy slippers
yeah
what do you think he dropped on the floor
the soap I think
right
when they have finished washing they dry
they use big towels and little towels and a lot of dusting powder
all the men shave except for three who have beards
two of them trim
then
then see what's he doing
right
then when the one hundred and five people are showered and bathed shaved and toweled dusted and dried they put on their underwear
huh
mhm
yes he has a beard so he's not shaving he's got quite a scraggly beard doesn't he
yeah
right
you're right
and men wear under shorts or briefs
yeah he does look like he needs a trim doesn't he
they are giving them to themselves trims right
yeah
he looks like he could use a little trim
but
I guess he likes his hair long like that
yeah some of the men wear teeshirt undershirts with sleeves and some with undershirts without sleeves
and a few of the ninety two do not wear undershirts at all
the night and the temperature are falling and one thin man buttons up a suit of long sleeve long legged underwear
all of the men put on black socks
there are short socks and long socks and fancy silk socks and that have decorations called clocks
I think that's what that is
some of the men wear leg garters to keep their long socks from falling down around their ankles
hm
the man with the long beard has a whole in his sock I think
yeah
the thirteen women put on different kinds of complicated underwear
underpants panty hose stockings petticoats slips and bras
one woman who's feet always freeze puts on wool socks over her stockings
mhm
she's wearing a slip which is kind of like a skirt but it goes under your skirt
uhuh
yeah
and what's she putting on
stockings
what's she putting on
a bra right
she's putting on a bra too
ah I think she's pulling up her stockings
I think she's putting her bra on too
those are her underpants
I think she's putting a slip on
she's got she's pulling her stockings up
she's putting her underpants on
no
when all the men have their underwear on they get into long sleeved white shirts and button them up
then they put on black trousers
forty five men stand up to get into their pants
forty seven sit down to put their pants on
each pair of pants has a shiny black stripe down the outside of each leg
the men zip zippers and button a button or two
one man has wavy black hair streaked with white like lightning
he puts on a very soft white shirt with ruffles down the front
it has special cuffs that fasten with cuff links
this man hooks a wide black cloth belt around his waist
the belt is called a cummerbund
like a
you know daddy wears a cummerbund when he wears his tuxedo which is his black suit and like when mommy and daddy have to go when we have to go to a wedding
daddy wears it right
remember
none of the other men wear belts with their pants they button suspenders onto the waist lines of their pants and snap the suspenders over their shoulders
snap
snap
eight women dress in long black skirts
they wear black tops sweaters or blouses
four women put on a long four women put on long black dresses and one wears a black jumper over a black shirt
a few of the women put jewelry on a necklace earrings but no bracelets
bracelets would get in the way when they're working
hm
yes indeedie
what is she playing
mm it's a bigger one though so I think it's probably a cello or a bass
yeah I think you're right
all the men put on black bow ties some tie them on in front of mirrors and some stare into space and tie them
the thin man whistles a tune as he ties his tie
twenty seven men have clip on ties that are already made into bows the man with the wavy black and white hair the ruffly shirt and the cummerbund ties on a very big white bow tie
it looks like a white bat
no one else has a tie like this he slips on a white vest and then a black jacket that is short in the front and long in the back where it divides in two like black beetle wings
right
the jacket and pants are called tails
really
really
oh my gosh that's a lot of beetles
huh where was the slug
on the ground
ee at school or at home
ooh
you're right it was at your home
and right and where did they go
they slugged away to their slug family
yucko
wow the slug especially I think is particularly yucky because he's kind of slimy
yeah
really
wow those are some slimy bugs huh
yeah
slimo
slimy slime
shall we keep reading
the man slips on a white vest and then a black jacket that has a shortened front oh yes that black beetle wings
the jacket and pants are called tails
tonight all the other ninety men put on tuxedo jackets
these are black too with shiny satin lapels
those are the lapels
but they do not have that beetle wing back
when all the men and women are completely dressed in black and white they get ready to go out
they put on overcoats jackets or caps boots or rubbers mitten or gloves
ah I guess he's not in this picture we'll have to keep looking to see if we can find him again
you mean the long black hair
the one with the long black hair
yeah
we'll keep looking
almost everyone picks up
it could be could be
right
almost everyone picks up a case the cases are different shapes and shades of black and brown
the man with the dark wavy hair with the white lightening in it the ruffly shirt the cummerbund and the bow tie that looks like a white bat picks up a very thin briefcase
no one else has a case like this
whada you think they have in all these big cases
I think they have musical instruments
yeah
yeah I think so like maybe a violin
and a flute
and a bass
and a french horn
that's a good question maybe trumpet
yeah maybe it is
oh that's that's definitely a bass because it's so big it's on wheels maybe that's a bass and that's a cello maybe
yeah
all the one hundred and five men and women say goodbye
goodbye to their mothers fathers husbands wives or friends children dogs birds a cat whoever is staying at home
the baby's staying at home look at that baby all tucked into his crib
yeah I need some stuffed animals in that crib
that's
yeah
oh because you're
right
gray's nice
and they walk out of one hundred and five doors into one hundred and five streets
and there they take taxi cabs cars subways or busses to the middle of the city
I still don't see her we'll have to keep looking
alrightie then
the man with the black and white wavy hair wears a black coat with a velvet color and a white silk scarf
he steps into a very long car that is waiting for him outside his apartment building
while the driver drives the man opens his case and looks at some papers
he sings a little and he hums
can you hum
yup
yeah you know what I think I see that one with the black long hair right
here's one with some brown long hair
I don't know if there is anyone with long white hair
well here's some with blonde hair

I think you're right
mhm
oop

maybe
they have left their overcoats jackets or capes boots or rubbers mittens or gloves some scarves many hats few earmuffs backstage in dark green metal lockers
they have left their cases in different shapes and shades of black and brown back there too
I think right here and here maybe two there are two basses
well I think the violins are here because they're much smaller see
I think we have four different things we have the violin then a little bit bigger is a viola
and then this I guess would be the cello right here
and then these very super big ones are the basses
one hundred and one of the men are women are carrying the musical instruments that were in those cases
three people do not carry instruments
they are the harpist who plays the harp
where's the harpist

the two timpanists who play the kettle drums and smaller percussion instruments the cymbals and a gong
these instruments
well these are all the percussion instruments these are the kettle drums
and these are the smaller percussion instruments
there are cymbals there's a gong
and there's a tambourine
that's a that's a gong
a gong
it's you take this little mallet and you hit the gong and it goes gong
it's true it's called a gong
these instruments are too heavy to carry around carry around so they are already on the stage
there are one hundred and two chairs on the stage and two stools
near each of these there is a music stand with sheets of music on it
one hundred and four people take their seats the double bass players sit on stools see the big double bass

yeah
everyone turns to the first page of music it is a white page covered with black lines and musical notes
the man with the black wavy hair lit with white enters the room
he walks to the front of the stage and steps one step up onto a box called a
podium
there he can be seen very clearly by the one hundred and four people on the stage and by the hundreds of people in the audience
the audience applauds
the man bows
he is the conductor the leader of the orchestra and he holds a stick in his hand
it's called a baton which is French for stick
who's from France
do you know someone from France
well I think she's at your school
oh yeah
that's right from France
yes she is
you're so silly

look the conductor raises the baton into the air and way up on the ceiling of philharmonic hall six chandeliers sparkle silently
there's a chandelier at the state house
yeah
the conductor brings the baton down and the hall which is as wide and long as a red velvet football field
fills with music
huh it's in New York
the music floats and rises it sings and dances from violas violins cellos double basses

thank you
oh thank you
should we read
should we read your prehistoric animals
alrighty
the prehistoric animals included in this book are just a few of the strange and interesting creatures that once roamed our planet
huh what's that
a woolly mammoth
wow
sure
woolly mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the woolly mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall
and appeared about two million years ago during the Ice Age of the Pleistocene epoch
right what was the one that we saw at the Pequot museum remember we saw one
oh the mastodon
right
looks similar
right
during the Ice Age massive ice sheets called glaciers covered vast areas of land
because it had a thick layer of fat under its skin as well as abundant hair the woolly mammoth managed to keep warm in the year round winter
crash
yeah I think so
the mammoth lost relatively little body heat through it's ears
boom
it's ears were very small
it's long curved tusks enabled it to find food by clearing away snow and ice
woolly mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia
prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals
wow
very long
huh who's this
the saber tooth tigers first appeared sometime between twenty six and thirty six million years ago
oh my gosh his tusks are going in his mouth
wow
there we go
the scientific name for the saber tooth tiger is Machairodont Machairodont Machairodont
does that sound better
you think Machairodont
this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws
these cats were carnivores or meat eaters and use their sharp sharp teeth to pierce the thick skins of the plant eating animals
one of the best know saber tooth tigers is the Smiladon which means knife tooth in Latin
exact
yeah Smiladon sounds like mastodon
they're both Latin names
hello smarty pants
the Machrauchenia
wow
Machrauchenia means large throat
Machrauchenia was a plant eater or an herbivore that
achoo
what a long nose he has
achoo
the Machrauchenia was about eleven feet tall and was shaped like a camel but with no humps
fossils show that its nose openings were high up on the skull suggesting that it had some sort of trunk
it woulduv used its trunk as an elephant does today to obtain food and water
since each of its toes were hoofed Machrauchenia would've been able to run quickly to escape predators
huh what's this
that is the Brontotherium
it sounds like a brontosaurus right
it looks more like what
what animal does the Brontotherium look like
kinduv like a hippo kinduv like a rhinoceros
yeah I think so
Brontotherium was a plant eater that grew up to eight feet tall
although it looked like a modern day rhinoceros the two animals are only distantly related
Brontotherium lived in the warm forest and had a large forked horn on its snout that was shaped like a y do you see its horn
yeah here's the y shaped one now up here see
that's his nose
his snout
yeah
okay what comes next
huh you remember
right
wow this is a Thorahockis
yes
that one goes
oh the woolly mammoth
he goes
hello I'm a woolly mammoth
I'm a saber tooth tiger
I'm a tiger
you're right
right I'm a Machrauchenia
what's that
that's the Brontotherium
yes
hello
I'm a Brontotherium
huh
hello I'm a Thorahockis
like kkinduv like an ostrich right
yeah or an emu
right
hello I'm a bird
huh
hello I'm a giant sloth
wow that is one big sloth huh
yeah let's see what it says about the sloth here
it says the giant sloth was truly huge about twenty feet long from nose to tail
I'm huge
let's see this one says we're strange creatures
the woolly mammoth says I have long tusks and wooly hair
this one says
that one says the wooly hair has the woolly mammoth has long shaggy hair and is just thirteen feet tall
this one says the saber tooth tiger has long pointy fangs
this one says the Machrauchenia has a long trunklike nose
the Brontotherium says that the Brontotherium ate leaves and fruit from the trees
the Thorahockis says that the birds could not fly they ran on their feet
mhm
the Machrauchenia says I have a long nose
it says that the Machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps
the Brontotherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns
this one says that there were lots of unusual creatures that roamed the earth many many years ago
it says the woolly mammoth had pretty small ears
that says that the woolly mammoth lived during the Ice Age
it says that one of the saber tooth tigers was called a Smiladon
it had long knife like teeth which were over six inches long
the Machrauchenia says that it ate plants
mhm
and a long trunk like nose
wow
achoo
achoo
the Brontotherium says they had a y shaped forked horn on the top of their snout
the Thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings
because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs
yummy
huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue
but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult
yeah
although its slow progress made the giant sloth an easy target for meat eaters its claws served as effective weapons
the giant sloth probably only became extinct about eleven million years ago
interesting
mhm
that is a neat book
yeah
well it says that lots of interesting creatures roamed the earth millions of years ago
they were the predecessors to lots of the animals that we see today
ah the giant sloth
he says I'm truly huge
yeah
huh the woolly mammoth
saber tooth tiger
oh no she's not
the Machrauchenia
oh my gosh is that a rhinoceros
the Brontotherium
oh is that an ostrich
that's a Thorahockis you're right
oh my gosh that's truly huge what is it
hm
don't think so what animal I think we missed a page
yeah yeah
the giant sloth
oh my gosh
oh my gosh
oh the giant sloth got you with his claws
huh hey honey your magic wand is one the dining room chair
