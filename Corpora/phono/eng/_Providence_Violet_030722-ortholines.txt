yeah
we re just moving into an apartment for now
well until we figure out what we re gonna do we don t know Harry s still looking for a job down here and we don t know if we re gonna move like maybe to like Bristol or somewhere like you know a little outside of Providence so we can put the kids in the public school
so we re just waiting to figure that out but right now we re gonna sell our house so we can get over there so it s just easier
not yet but I m I m I well I looked at some so I know there s a lot out there right now there s tons of them but I I m waiting until we until we know when we re gonna sell our house because we just put it on the market like yesterday
so I m gonna wait and see what happens you know
because I don t wanna rent an apartment and then lose money because I don t know when we re gonna close or anything you know
so
oh yeah yeah
he does he s just
well we want I wanna be closer to the kids school because they ll both be in school at the same school next year
and he he s thinking about maybe quitting his job and having a couple months to look for another job because he he can t find another job while he s working it s like impossible
you know and so if we sell the house we ll have some money and he won t have to stress about it so
we re not sure we re not sure what we re doing but we re selling the house we know that
so
we ll figure it out from there how how s your health
yeah

yeah
huh
oh okay
yep
another fun thing to happen right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
huh
ooh cool
