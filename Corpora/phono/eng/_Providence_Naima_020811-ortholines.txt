am I right is it you
oh

tomorrow
we are going to leave to go on our journey right after breakfast
okay
yeah today we saw puddles in the potholes
there were some today
I think because it had rained a few days ago

just recently but it did rain a few days ago
and so the rain
the water
rain water was still there
well I don t know it just was still there
when we go on our journey tomorrow do you wannna bring what s my job and so you can show it to Grandma and play it with her
she might really like playing that game
with you
you know who else we re gonna see
we re gonna see Uncle

he does

lives closer to you now
does he like it better here
because he s closer to you here
mhm
oh would you like to get down
you done with your raspberries
yep all gone
the raspberries are all gone all gone
alrightie
money is running through our fingers Max
she means they re spending too much money
because
because he was hungry and he needed his clothes washed
so they had to spend money
on the
dry cleaner s and
she wasn t expecting to spend all that money on those things she was expecting to spend money on Grandma s birthday present
Sleepy didn t
it looks like you have a little food on your sleeve here
should we take this shirt off and put on
something else
would you like to have a bath tonight
I think it would be a really good idea to have a bath and you could
play with lego animal
in a little while
panther panther panther
did Daddy play that with you
in the bath
I don t think
oh is that what happens sometimes
I see hm
hm
the ducky rides on the top of the bathtub
oh
oh
the ducky rides on top of the
the sail of the boat
I see
I m gonna get that little purple
thing for you to wear
okay
here we are back again
you talking to the to the tape
well I m just talking to the person who s gonna transcribe
this is still November twenty fifth just moments later
you re wearing your little purple purse
it s very nice looking
this is actually a letter to Clare mother
and I m gonna put it up here with some other mail
that I need
that I need to send in the mail
my little one
oh
okay
we could do that
that s what your old letter to him says it says I went right to a party
wanna stay
say the same thing in your letter
can you sort the silverware for me is that something you could do right now
because it s over there
it needs to be sorted
yeah
yeah
in your letter you wanna say the same thing
alright
well we can do that
mhm
mhm
hm
yeah
I will need to get some paper
and a pen or a pencil to write it down for you
okay I don t have pencil and paper right now
but when I get some after I finish putting away the dishes then I will write down what you would like me to say to him
in your letter
I don t think that s a measuring cup I think that might be
the dust
a little brush for sweeping the floor
that is what it is
see
yes
it is
where do you think that would be
oh something came off
whoops
can I put this here
let s see if this is okay to put it right here
where do you think he ll see it
you put it where you think he ll see it
hey
oh you think he ll see it best there
alright
maybe we can also just remind him that we put it there
that might help
that s actually a magazine for Daddy
you smelling something
you smelling the food cooking
oh would you like a tissue to blow it with
would you like a tissue honey
you feeling alright
really
oh you mean because of this
does that feel better now or is it still hurting
you know what you might need to use the potty sometimes that can make your tummy hurt
shall we go together
okay
let s do that
alright
little potty or big potty
hm
can you take off your long john
you don t need to take them all the way off
you can just leave them on
you can still sit on the potty even though they re on your ankles
okay
the book on the floor
oh yeah
okay I ll read this one
it s called lift the lid use the potty
and it goes like this
here is little bunny s brand new purple potty
lift the lid what s inside
oh want me to go back to that page
oh there s the flap
a think that s a waste
a waste basket
it s a toy
what s it doing in there
oh did we skip something
oh the pocket
flap I forgot about that
oh
there s a baby sister
there s the lollipops
why does she keep them in her pocket
I don t know
I don t know
should I turn the page
little bunny s baby sister goes in her diaper
little bunny used to but not anymore
she s making a face
because of the smell
right
she doesn t like the smell
that s before she smells the poopy diaper
hm
the mommy is
changing the baby s diaper
oh she s probably worried about the baby getting a diaper rash
because when you wear a diaper instead of using a potty you can get a diaper rash
why did you tear it off
I have no idea do you remember why
I don t know why
now when little bunny has to go it s potty time
she pulls down her pants and lifts the lid
she can probably pull down her own big kid pants
after little bunny goes it s time to wipe
want me to read the little book
time to use the potty
sit sit sit I sit and wait
turn the page
then it says
time to wipe
yippee I used the potty
little bunny sits on the potty and goes
after little bunny goes it s time to wipe
hm what s there
time to wash and dry those hands while Mommy pours the pee pee in the toilet
then it s time to flush
whoosh
bye bye pee pee
oh okay
did you skip a flap
what s in
the box
what s in her box
big kid pants
there was a flap there it s not there anymore
you tore it off
when you were
a younger toddler
because maybe you didn t understand that you shouldn t tear flaps off of flap books
I don t know there must have been a flap there too
do you remember when there was stickers on this
you know if you wanted to you could get
we could get some
potty stickers and we could put them there
but start putting them there instead of
see because that potty poster is almost full
we could use this again
we could a
we could get a bunch of maybe the
we could get a bunch of small stickers that would fit over the numbers
and you could use this again
would you like to do that
well I mean one that wouldn t be too big
we wouldn t want one that would be
that would cover up more than one number
maybe I could find some
that you could use
that would be the right size
and we could even take it with us when we go on our journey and that way you could have potty stickers on your journey
should we take a potty with us on our journey
yeaah
maybe because she s too short and he s tall enough to reach
which potty do you think we should take with us on the journey should we take this potty seat and leave these two at home
okay we could bring the bunny potty
should we bring the seat too maybe
this one
should we bring a stool with us
oh I see
when we go on our journey
at the vacation house
do you wanna use this one
alright
okay I think you re ready to wipe aren t you
that s the end of the book
oh alright
go ahead then
you know if your tummy ever hurts like that again
your stomach
then you ll know that maybe it s time to use the potty
remember your
you came to me and you said my tummy is hurting
and I said sometimes that means you need to use the potty
and I was right
that s number thirteen
this whole thing
it s toilet paper
twenty nine
twenty eight
those are numbers
twenty seven
twenty six
twenty five
twenty four
twenty three
twenty two
twenty one
and now I would like to go eat my supper so I d like you to wipe
