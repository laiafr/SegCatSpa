this patient s teeth are hurting
what happened to the patient s teeth d you think
rotten
really
are you examining each tooth carefully
how many teeth
does that bear have any bear teeth
what about dog teeth
does he have dog teeth
that s a lot of teeth
and which ones are rotten
how many teeth are rotten
are there only certain ones that are rotten
oh dear
let me have a look
oh yeah I see whatchu mean
hm do you think we should just
fill the cavity
a cavity is a hole in your tooth that you get when your teeth are really rotten
okay
okay
then maybe we better fill it with something
oh
yes that is your name
doctor dentist
doctor
are you doctor Naima
yeah
okay
well dentists use the name doctor in front of their names sometimes
just like for other kinds of doctors
cause a dentist is really a tooth doctor
that s why
what s the patient s name
uhhuh
oh the tool for looking in the mouth is on the floor
can I look in his mouth also
okay
okay Mister Bear
yeah I m the assistant
yes oh yes I see that rotten tooth right there
okay
I think we should fill it
we should fill the hole in the tooth
well
that will help the tooth get better
if it s really rotten we might have to pull it out but I don t think it s that bad
do you
oh we have to pull it out
mm
hm okay
well
hm we need might need some special other tools for that
can you go find our special tools for pulling teeth out
you know what you might want to use is the
the
whadaya call em
tongs
not the toast tongs the metal tongs
d you know where they are
I don t know actually
see
come here for a minute
you know what
this is what
this is
this is what being
this is what feeling cranky and grumpy is
and this
and this is
this is when you need a nap
this is how you feel you get upset about things
oh
what
wipe your nose
oh okay
what
oh don t say anything okay
I will try to
oh my gosh
I think you might wanna take a nap because
you know why
because it might help you feel good
that s why
sometimes
but imonna help you look for those tongs now but I do want to keep talking to you about a nap because I know that when you take a nap sometimes it helps you feel better
it s not
oh you know what
why don t we give this to the patient
it might make his teeth feel better
I m lookin for the tongs
oh you know what
I wonder if they re in the kitchen with all your other
equipment
d you think
they could be there
you know what we re gonna need to go for a drive in a little while because we don t have any yogurt
we have to buy yogurt
there s no yogurt in our house except for the baby yogurt that s the flavor that you don t like
so I think it would be good if we went in the car
to get some yogurt
after we take the patient s tooth out
when he s ready to leave
then we can leave too
here s the tongs
yeah
yeah the silver part
I m gonna put the cookies away
in the cookie jar
these are nut cookies

either this one or your table
okay
okay
okay
yeah
mm okay I m gonna come along with you
here s a little thing to squirt water in their mouth
hm
probably lots of things you can pretend
oh
it s the syringe
how bout the syringe
I think it would be a good pretend thing that squirts water into the dental patient s mouth
did you find a syringe
I think that s enough
we need a coupla other things besides yogurt not a lot though
but you know what
if I don t find my wallet
we won t have any money to buy the yogurt with
and I m not exactly sure where to find it
oh I m sorry

I ll give you all squares

you wanna wrap it around him
alright
oh
his
he won t be able to breathe if you cover his head
he does
everybody has to breathe
is that right

you could do it like this and it would fit around his neck
like that
Naima I have to make a phone call
write something down
what re you gonna write down
don t you need paper to write something down
well you know what the problem is that the pastels are really hard to
they smudge a lot
so I wouldn t use them for cards that we re gonna give our children who are friends

okay
I think I ll give you a white piece of paper okay

are you in the car
okay
oh you re making music
you you you
why is he excited
ha ha is he

you tickling the bee
I don t know that s a good question and I don t remember
you know Daddy might remember because
he used to play that when he was a kid
he tells me
do you know that that s a magnet
no he s not but he s coming soon
yeah okay
you ask him that when he comes
it s the present for
it s a book for
it s his birthday is coming up

who s that
who s that
what
it s Daddy sweetie it s just Daddy
it s just Daddy
here s my
where s my darling daughter
where am I supposed to get the stings
oh
are there supposed to be
oh I don t know
remember that game
I understand
yes he doesn t know
that s okay that he doesn t know he doesn t have to know
can you say hi to Daddy
I think is it on the back
tickle the tickle bee around the maze with as few stings as possible
follow drawing on how to do the tickle
when the head of the tickle bee is touched
by the magnetic tickler
this is considered a sting
I see what you re supposed to do
oh I see
you re supposed to push it like this
that s how you do it you push it like this
and if it hits
if you hit it that s a sting
that s how it works
mm well it s just a pretend sting
it s a pretend sting in the game
that s what it is
I m gonna get comfy
yeah when it
you see if you do that side it touches the head that s a sting
if you do this side it pushes the tail and moves it along
that s not a sting
that s how it works
I m gonna get comfy
good idea
get comfy Daddy
okay
that s it for this taping
