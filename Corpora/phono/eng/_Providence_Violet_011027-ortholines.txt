last year our town celebrated his birthday with a special events and a big parade
Clifford and I dressed up Clifford looked like
looked good in the fake beard I made for him
look every putting on costumes
we went to the city park to see the old fashioned games and contest
one team of old horses in a log contest
was having a hard time
Clifford felt sorry for them
he gave them some help
see he push
Clifford wanted to join the bicycle obstacle race
he couldn t ride a bike so
he got in the race as in obstacle look
the kids ride their bikes over him
some men were pitching horseshoes
Clifford wanted to try that too
he made a mistake
look he picked up a whole horse
luckily I stopped him before it was too late
next we played volleyball
Clifford was keeping his eye on the ball
but he forgot about the net
poor Clifford
we saw some people getting ready for a pie eating contest
now that looked like something Clifford would enjoy
it was
Clifford was the champion pie eater
afterward Clifford tried to lift the pie crumbs off his fake beard
some birds came to help
the birds liked the beard more than Clifford did
we left it behind and went off to get ready for the big parade
there were bands and floats lining up in front of the school
one float was being decorated with all kinds of flowers
someone forgot that bees love flowers
Clifford forgot to shoo the bees away but that didn t work
saw the bees
he took a big breath and blew those bees out of town
the mayor did something special to thank Clifford for chasing the bees away
he made Clifford the leader of the parade
here comes the parade
at last everything was ready
we re going to march down Main Street and cross the town bridge
suddenly a man ran up and stopped the parade
there was trouble ahead of the bridge
Clifford and I rushed off as fast as we could
oh no the bridge had collapsed
Clifford did some quick thinking
can you guess what happened then
the big parade went on as planned but Clifford wasn t in it he was under it
look he fixed the bridge
good old Clifford saved the day
it was the best birthday party ever
