why don't you think I'm recording Naima
is that a reason
oh okay
I am going to record you and me that's what I'm trying to do
today is Friday the twenty fifth
of July two thousand and three
and you can see yourself when it's done you can't see yourself now
so
we're about
three days late recording
and have switched
batteries in the receiver and one of the transmitters
and not in the other transmitter
cause that seemed to be a problem
really
I see more bear food here
how
how bout yogurt
would you like yogurt to have with those almonds
how bout some Oatios
how bout some Kamut cake
how bout some cheese
alright
I think bears do like cheese especially bear
I think bears do like cheese especially bear cubs
where's the cheese here it is
oh what a rawring bear
that's quite a rawr Naima
that's quite a roar
doesn't like the bear food
why not
why doesn't the bear like the bear food
what that's cheese you like cheese
a smaller piece
dyou say the bear's tummy would like a smaller piece
here put that cheese down I'll cut that too
put it down I'll cut it
very funny
very funny
it's a cheese square
you have
what
that's the shape of a curve oh that piece of cheese
let's see
yeah it does have a curve you're right
curve cheese
do you have any triangles
it doesn't rock well blocks that are curved can rock cheese that is curved probably won't rock as well
do you want crackers with your cheese
here's the crackers
you rearranging your cheese
you straightening up
mm
hm
are you making a little sandwich
is it a sunny day today
what kind of a day is it
hm it's a Mommy day
are you sure it's not a Naima day
it's a lovely Naima day today
mhm I bet would love to take you to the play ground today
well maybe
well you need to make sure you have lunch before you have ice cream
besides are you gonna go shopping with and buy the eggs
but I need you to buy eggs
why not
that would be very helpful for Mommy
don't you like helping Mommy
no usually you do like helping
you joking
you're joking yeah
I thought so
rawr
you could be the only bear in the store if you go to the store
you could bring Grizzly to the store and put him next to you in the wagon
and Griz could ride in the car too
and Griz could wear the booties
and you could even carry him in the backpack in the store if you want
go with and buy the eggs and show Griz where the eggs are in the store
I bet he doesn't know cause he's a little bear
yup you know and you could show him
you could show him what things a store has
I don't think Griz has I think maybe Sleepy Bear's been to the store with you but I don't think Griz has been to the store
Sleepy's a big bear
oh he can buy things
Sleepy or Griz
who are we talking about now
mhm
why do I think you should have lunch before ice cream
cause ice cream is a treat
it's a little bit special
and you need to make sure you have things with protein before you eat ice cream
it's just a rule
it is a rule
don't spill that please
well please don't take it out that's gonna make a
Naima
are you making a mess I'm gonna take this away from you
well then stop making the mess good
those are almonds

it looks just like almonds
ground up almonds
you're telling me that's an apple

what's gasoline for Naima
for Mister Frumble does he get gasoline
oh really
she does cut his tie by accident that's right
I think because he's oh you mean does he do that when he's shaving no that's when he's getting a haircut isn't it
I think the barber cuts his tie by accident
oh because Mister Frumble is hm moving around too much when you get your hair cut you're not supposed to move around too much
you singing a Mommy song

do you want koala to watch
you go down the slide
you're having fun
what are those Naima

you're gonna make a pile
are you gonna make a pass
what do you mean like a pass that when you go to a movie or a not a movie but a the zoo
what do you mean by pass
oh a path is that what you mean a path
oh
is somebody gonna walk on the path
oh they look like stepping stones
alright who's gonna walk on the path
you
oh Naima is
all over the path
step by step a step by step
a path
why
Naima
so you can step on it
is that sort of like you do on your balance beam
yeah
the fish are all wrinkled
what is the name of this one
who's that
baby Kate
oh
take off the undershirt
oh
yeah well you got it off
her hands stick together
oh there your dolly your dolly's right over there with her yellow dress
you can take it off the dolly
and put it on her
okay
she's gonna be all dressed up
she's gonna nurse
mm okay
with mommy koala
she's gonna eat eucalyptus oh
mhm
did you see a koala at the zoo
was there just one or was there a mommy and a baby
there baby koala's all dressed now
she's nursing
oh the dress is affected by the humidity
just like your door stuck shut because it was affected by the humidity
why
because there's moisture
there's water in the air
yeah
water and moisture
in the air and it swells things up
so that's why it sticks
cause it made your door a little bit bigger
and that's why it was sticking
to the movie
I don't think both of them will fit if you put them laying down
what what does he need
which blanket you gonna put in
what do ya want
you want it to hang
how bout something like this
is that better
Sleepy Bear's gonna go in the stroller
yeah if you put all four wheels down it'll be easier to push
Naima
do you wanna put koala on the bottom
you could put koala on the bottom or grizzly on the bottom
of your stroller
he might fit
he doesn't fit
he's a little bit too big
yeah his head is affected by the humidity
yeah Koala might fit
yeah Koala does fit maybe Baby Koala can fit on top of Mama Koala
yes where are you gonna take them
yeah Koala fits
the
grizzly would fit in the top
but then you'd have to take Sleepy Bear out
well they might both fit do you think both of them would fit in the top
you gonna try and see if they both fit in the top of the carriage
think he's losing his shirt
there it rolls if you keep all four wheels down it'll roll easier
where do you want Griz to go
you want me Griz to stay with me
I'll stay with Griz
you wanna bring Griz's shirt over
yeah
I will I'll put it on
you want it on you
do you want the shirt on you
you want it
alright we'll put your shirt on
Naima bear needs a shirt
are you cold oh well I don't want you to be cold
I want you to be warm
and cozy I want you to be cozy
now you got a shirt on
I can put the undershirt on grizzly bear
yeah but now grizzly bear can wear it
okay it's a little bit big
supper
