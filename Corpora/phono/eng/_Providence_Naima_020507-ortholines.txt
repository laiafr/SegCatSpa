let s brush your teeth now Naima
why do they what
well so they don t run into the land and break the ship that s why
why because ships are for the ocean they re just for floating in the water they don t come on land
and sometimes if they hit the land they can break
and water can get on the ship and it could sink so they want to stay away from the land
and when it s foggy they can t see the land
and if they can t see the land they don t know where it is that s why fog horns help them fog horns help them know where the land is
come sit here little ship
so when it s really foggy all they have to do is listen
and when they listen they can hear the fog horn and that tells them oh there s land there we better stay away
so whenever they hear it
can you face me so I can brush your teeth
they know to stay away
are you a ship
oh you better listen for fog horns then
oh boy
can you face Mommy so I can brush your teeth
Daddy is a fog horn

I didn t know you were a little mommy
swikka dikka dameek
a swikka dikka dameek
oh
you re a sweet Naima
you re getting warm are you cold
we should put some pajamas on you
it s almost time for sleep whoa clunk sleep time
your nursie drops you off at the Nurney s house
oh my goodness
I never heard of such a thing
I never heard of such a thing
do you wanna wear your blue and yellow pajamas or your pink and orange pajamas
I don t know about any pajamas
nursie pajamas
hm
you re picking up the nursies that you love
thank you should I put them back in my shirt
okay they re back in my shirt now
computer nursies
what are computer nursies
what
are you being silly Miss silly
shall we get pajamas now
you want the pink ones or the blue ones
I don t know about any nursie pajamas
you want a nursing shirt
Mommy is the one who wears nursing shirts
not Naima
you don t have any nursing shirts
well I ll get the pink and orange nursing shirt for you okay
what d ya mean no
you know what we never combed your hair after your bath
and we should put hair elastics in shouldn t we
oh okay I see there s a theme here
I think maybe it s time to stop taping
the seam
oh the theme
do you know what a theme is
a theme is kind of like an idea
and I said there s a theme here
and the theme was that you were talking about nursing a lot
oh in the drug store at the
or whatever
I m sorry Naima what were you saying
because Mister Fixit fixed it
but he s a funny guy Mister Fixit he fixes things in funny ways
I think he was supposed to fix it so that it would say Mama again two hands please
oh
but instead he fixed it and now it says Dada
funny Mister Fixit
you re having some of this too right
I don t know
yes
careful with the glass
olive oil
humor me
I just need something and I don t have butter
oh the plate
almond butter is healthy
yeah I m gonna put that on
salmon
why did
I m sorry Naima I wasn t paying attention to you
oh he does
but it s kinda mysterious they don t say why
they don t say what he does it actually sounds not only mysterious it sounds ominous
Naima please don t wipe your hands on the table like that
I don t want you to do that are you gonna eat some egg white and egg yolk
yes
so that Sam can play with it
it s a toy boat isn t it
is it a toy boat
no it s a big boat somebody s in it while he s fixing it
oh
so that it won t sink
if a boat has a leak it might sink
it might go to the bottom
it might go to the bottom of the ocean
I guess Philip s wagon was broken
maybe the wheel was broken
Mister Fixit likes to fix everything he touches practically
because I think he must have been using the wrong
he must have been using the wrong directions
when he was fixing it
he was supposed to fix it so it said Mama
but instead he fixed it so it said Dada
I think he probably was reading the wrong directions when he fixed it
like sometimes you need directions to fix things you need to read from a paper with directions
hm
like Babaji fixed his refrigerator
his refrigerator wasn t making any ice
and he fixed it
he had to read the directions for how to fix it
and then he fixed it
hm and hm
remember what was I reading oh remember when I was trying to try out the backpack to carry you in
I had to read the directions
directions explain how to use something or how to fix something
mhm
when it first came when we first took it out of the box
be careful don t spill that drink okay
more
a smoothie is a drink
yeah I would eat more toast
I would basically eat toast until toast stops coming my way
do you want some help getting that out
you re trying to frost it
why don t I help you
mm egg yolk yum yum yum
it s still a little bit foggy out there Naima
did you hear the weather
I didn t
I mean yesterday it was overcast much of the morning and then it burned off
it was spectacular
a spectacular turnaround
I wonder if fog is a mosquito deterrent
hm
wishful thinking
I don t think so
mosquitos repelled by fog
could be the cool temperatures associated with it
hm
i wonder if there s hot fog and cold fog
there are probably many different kinds of fog
but we don t know them
we would probably have fifty words for fog if we lived in Maine
and warm fog
and warm fog
yes
probably there s warm fog too
well you know there s a certain appeal to even though it s foggy at the moment
to
taking a day like this to go to Eastport
because
mhm no I was gonna suggest the same
it s sort of the urban entertainment
all three blocks of it
well I think Lubbeck is becoming the more sophisticated
I don t know about that you d think that but I don t know why
urban renewal spot
The Home Port restaurant and summer keys
Naima eat please don t please don t play with that
the kids in the
those things have been those things have both been here a long time it s not becoming
oh yeah
with your fingers do you wanna use the knife
with your fingers sometimes you do that sometimes you can do that do you wanna knife or do you wanna do it with your fingers
or you wanna
oh you already did it I think
okay
why ncha eat some
you can cut one piece and then I want you to eat it
mm
is it really shorter to go on the ferries
oh it in terms of amount of time no it s probably shorter to go the other way cause I think if you drive to Eastport it s probably about an hour
from here
yeah
it s just it s more interesting and more broken up but you know if you go by ferry I mean if it s say fifteen minutes for the ferry each ferry that s half an hour of a wait plus each one is about twenty five minutes that s an hour and a half plus the drive time so
it s probably longer to go that way
not that it ll be very spectacular that is really one of the Eastport to Deer Island ferry is just one of those local ferries
well the thing is if we drove there and then took the ferry back by then it might not
oh good idea
babe
we could get mustard
oh dear hm
you know we still have oh
are you talking to Dad I m sorry
it s not properly calibrated
that s alright I ll I ll
I haven t calibrated my slice thickness
yes baby
what is it
say that again
oh what mosquitos the fog might do
I don t quite understand the question but I think you re saying what the what might the fog do to mosquitos
I think that s what you re asking
hm
cause I said maybe that s
well Mommy thought maybe mosquitos don t like fog so that the fog will keep them away
Mommy was more hoping that than thinking that
I think Mommy was engaging in something called wishful thinking
yes
that s called wishful thinking that s when you wish something s true
even if it s not
I don t think toddlers are supposed to have that level of reasoning yet
because toddlers are toddlers what are you doing
hey what are you doing with the
d ya want more
smoothie Boobaloo
you can have more smoothie if you want
does Miss Boo want more smoothie
good good
that s a good smoothie isn t it Naima
and you have lots of egg and egg white Daddy might eat some
Daddy s gonna eat some mm
oh that s for Daddy too
are you gonna feed me
mm
good
are you taking turns eating with Daddy
yes I did Naima
mm I m chewing it and I m swallowing it
and I m washing it down
just like Naima does
I don t want egg yolk thank you Naima you should eat it
you can have egg yolk
you should eat it
it s good but it s for you
yeah I ll eat the egg white
mm I like egg white
do you like feeding Daddy
it s a little too close to the edge
mm Daddy likes egg yolk really a lot
it has protein in it
that s the dirty little secret about egg whites
you did thank you
right to Daddy
oh that one
okay thank you
a crumb of egg yolk not a piece of egg yolk
now your turn
no it s your turn
I want you to eat it a little bit more now
Daddy s gonna watch while Naima eats
I am
cause I like protein it s healthy for me
I think the other thing is
are you done Boo Boo
yes
oh I heard a burp
why ncha finish the smoothie that s in the glass
the placement of words in question formation is occasionally correct now
oh
mm that was good thank you
okay I believe you
thank you
it s moothie the smoothie is moothie
let s take let s take your bib off and then let s clean you up
it s moothie
mhm
oh I see some egg white right there and I see some almond butter on your pants
I saw that
he was eating it right from your hand like a bird
you were offering it to him with your hand
I m gonna wipe off your hands a little
tweet tweet
what kinda bird are you
oh
mhm
they do I haven t seen a robin in a while
are you a grown up robin or a toddler robin or a baby robin
oh are you a robin chick
hi robin chick
mhm
why
oh Daddy does have a brown cereal I gotta switch over to that I think
mm
for medicinal purposes
yes wash why don t you wash your hands at the sink now too okay
oh you want Daddy to clean I thought Mommy just did Mommy just cleaned you up like a baby do you want Daddy to clean you up
I think I just cleaned you up like a baby but I think your hands still have some residue on them
well shall we go wash your hands then
oh Naima you
